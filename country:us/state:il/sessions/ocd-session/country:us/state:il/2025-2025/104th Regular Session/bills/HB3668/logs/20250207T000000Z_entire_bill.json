      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act. Requires an agency in a proposed rulemaking to carry out, before moving to the second notice period, a good-faith analysis of the net new costs to be imposed upon (i) entities in the private sector and (ii) units of local government and taxing bodies other than the State of Illinois. Provides that if the proposed rulemaking is found to impose net new costs upon those entities, the text of the proposed rule must contain reliefs to balance the net new costs. Prohibits the adoption or filing of any rule or modification or repeal of any rule that imposes net new costs upon any of those entities. Provides that the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules shall scrutinize compliance with these requirements and that any failure of an agency to comply shall trigger the prohibition or suspension of a proposed rule. Creates a private cause of action for a party injured by the adoption of a rule in violation of the requirements added by the amendatory Act."
