      "abstract": "Amends the Rebuild Illinois Mental Health Workforce Act. Provides that beginning January 1, 2026, for each State fiscal year, a monthly directed payment shall be paid to each community mental health provider of community support individual services based on the number of Medicaid users of community support individual services documented by Medicaid fee-for-service and managed care encounter claims delivered by the provider in the base year. Sets forth how the monthly directed payment shall be calculated. Requires the Department of Healthcare and Family Services to adjust and pay community mental health providers for any payments authorized for all services from a community mental health provider which have been paid by a Medicaid managed care organization but no encounter claim has been recorded in the Departments' Enterprise Data Warehouse. Provides that the Department must develop a process for community mental health providers to reconcile these payments and submit claims for which the Department has not used for making payments. Permits the Department to sanction Medicaid managed care organizations for services not received by the Department."
