Provides that, in making a decision upon a complaint filed by a complainant's agent, the board of review shall be limited to the evidence presented by the complainant or the complainant's agent, the county assessor, and a taxing district, and each complaint shall be limited to the grounds listed in the petition, the supporting documents filed with the board, and the rebuttal evidence filed with the board. Provides that no assessment may be revised and corrected until the complainant or the complainant's agent has been given a period of 30 days to review and rebut a decision of the board. Provides that an oral hearing shall be granted on request of any complainant or any complainant's agent. Provides that, when a board of review decision is made on a complaint, the board shall transmit a computer printout of the results, or make and sign a brief written statement of the decision (currently, a brief written statement of the reason for the change and the manner in which the method used by the assessor in making the assessment was erroneous)."
