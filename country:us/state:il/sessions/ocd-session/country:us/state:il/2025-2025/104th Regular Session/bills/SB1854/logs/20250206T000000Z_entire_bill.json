Provides that the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board shall conduct or approve a training program in death and homicide investigation for the training of Department of Corrections internal security investigators. Provides that only law enforcement officers and Department of Corrections internal security investigators (rather than just law enforcement officers) who successfully complete the training program may be assigned as lead investigators in death and homicide investigations. Provides that the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board shall develop a process for waiver applications sent by the Department of Corrections for those investigators whose prior training and experience as homicide investigators may qualify them for a waiver."
