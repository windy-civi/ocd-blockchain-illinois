      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act. Provides that, unless a rule provides for its automatic repeal on an earlier date, a rule is automatically repealed on the date that is 10 years after it first becomes effective. Provides that notice of the repeal shall be published in the Illinois Register not less than 30 nor more than 60 days before the effective date of the automatic repeal. Provides that, for each rule that first became effective more than 5 years before the effective date of the amendatory Act, the date the rule first became effective shall be deemed to be the date that is 5 years before the effective date of the amendatory Act. Provides that the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, in consultation with the Auditor General, within 12 months after the effective date of the amendatory Act, shall submit a report to the Governor and the General Assembly, with quarterly reports thereafter. Prohibits a State agency from adopting any rule that was automatically repealed after 10 years unless authorized by the subsequent passage of a bill and enactment of a law under the Constitution of the State of Illinois. Provides that the Joint Committee shall implement and supervise the automatic repeal of rules."
