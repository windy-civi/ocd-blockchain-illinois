      "abstract": "Amends the Property Tax Code. Establishes an Equity Fund. Provides that moneys in the Equity Fund shall be expended exclusively for the purpose of paying the amount ordered for equity surplus payments to Illinois property owners who have lost their property by a recorded tax deed, except that, whenever the State Treasurer determines that any such moneys in the Equity Fund exceed the amount required for the purpose of paying equity surplus payments resulting from property ownership being divested by tax deed, the State Treasurer may transfer any such excess amounts from the Equity Fund to the General Revenue Fund. Provides for an irrevocable and continuing appropriation from Illinois tax lien purchasers for the purpose of paying equity surplus payments to the divested property upon the order of the State Treasurer and for the purpose of paying equity surplus to the divested property owner. In provisions concerning the indemnity fund, makes changes to the fees that are collected for tax sales in counties of 3,000,000 or more inhabitants. Sets forth an Equity Fund fee, calculation of the equity surplus, and an application process. Makes conforming and other changes. Amends the State Finance Act to make a conforming change."
