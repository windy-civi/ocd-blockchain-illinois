      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Human Rights Act. Provides that a formerly convicted person may petition the Department of Human Rights for a grant of protected class status. Provides that the Department may grant protected class status to a formerly convicted person who meets the following conditions: the person has complied with each term and condition of the person's parole, mandatory supervised release, probation, or conditional discharge; the person has obtained a high school diploma or received a high school equivalency certificate; the person is employed or actively seeking employment or is enrolled in or has successfully completed a vocational training or college educational program; the person has not been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor within the last 5 years; and the person has completed all sanctions imposed upon the person through due process of law. Provides that the Department shall adopt rules concerning what constitutes an intellectual or developmental disability that prevents the formerly convicted person from meeting some of the conditions and who is qualified to diagnose such a person. Provides that the Department shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions. Provides that protected class status previously granted to a formerly convicted person shall be revoked by the Department after notice and a hearing, if the formerly convicted person is subsequently convicted of a felony or misdemeanor. Provides that the revocation process shall be initiated by a petition that sets forth the date of the subsequent offense, description of the offense, date of conviction for the subsequent offense, and sentence imposed on the conviction. Provides that a copy of the petition and notice of the hearing date shall be served on the formerly convicted person."
