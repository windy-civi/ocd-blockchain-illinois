      "abstract": "Creates the Curriculum Transparency Act. Requires each school that is operated by a school district or as a public charter school to disclose, not more than 10 days after the first use, on a publicly accessible portion of the school's website or the school district's website: (1) the procedures or processes in effect for the school principal or other staff to document, review, or approve lesson plans or the learning materials and activities used for student instruction at the school; (2) a listing of the teacher and staff training materials and activities used at the school in the current school year; and (3) a listing of the learning materials and activities used for student instruction at the school in the current school year. Provides that neither the State Board of Education nor the school district's school board or public charter school's governing body nor any staff acting in the course of their official duties shall purchase or contract for copyrighted learning materials to be used for student instruction at a school, unless provision is made to allow the parents and guardians of enrolled students to review the materials within 10 school days after the submission of a written request to the school. Sets forth ways a party may enforce the Act. Amends the Charter Schools Law of the School Code to make a related change."
