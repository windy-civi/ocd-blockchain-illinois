Provides that private property shall not be taken or damaged without just cause for public use or without just compensation as provided by law. Provides that such compensation shall be determined by a jury as provided by law. Provides that \"public use\" does not include public benefits of economic development, including an increase in tax base, tax revenues, employment, blight, or general economic health. Provides that private property may not be taken for the use of or ownership by any private individual or private entity, unless that property is necessary for conducting a common carrier or utility business benefiting local residents. Provides that only government entities have the power to exercise eminent domain, and this power cannot be delegated to any private entity. Provides that, after 7 years, if private property is not used for the purpose for which it was acquired, the original owner or the owner's successors and assigns have the right of first refusal to buy the property back at the original price or current fair market value, whichever is less. Effective upon being declared adopted."
