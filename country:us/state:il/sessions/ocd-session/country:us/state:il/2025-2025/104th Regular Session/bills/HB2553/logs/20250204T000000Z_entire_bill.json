Provides that a student is deemed incapable of consent, for purposes of this provision, when he or she is a student who attended the school while the employee was employed at the school. Provides that it is not a defense to a violation of this provision that the student was of the age to give consent to sexual penetration or sexual conduct in circumstances not involving a violation of this provision. Provides that a person convicted of violating this provision shall immediately forfeit his or her employment with a school and may not subsequently be employed at a school.
