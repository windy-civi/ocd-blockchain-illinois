Provides that for a child residing in a long-term, acute care facility serving a majority of patients who are (i) minor children and (ii) Medicaid-eligible in Harvey School District 152, if a parent or guardian moves out of the State after the child is placed in such a facility, that parent or guardian shall enroll the child in a school in the other state to initiate reimbursement to Illinois. With respect to determining the location of a student's parent or guardian, provides that the information submitted to the State Superintendent of Education must include an affidavit from that school district's superintendent or the facility's director attesting that the location of the parent or guardian is unknown and at least 3 satisfactory attempts (rather than 4 items of documentary evidence that a minimum of 4 separate attempts) were made on 3 separate days to locate the parent or guardian and no response was received from the parent or guardian within 14 days after such satisfactory attempts. Provides that for a child residing in a long-term, acute care facility serving a majority of patients who are (i) minor children and (ii) Medicaid-eligible in Harvey School District 152, the following apply: (1) if the child is not currently enrolled in a school district or if the resident school district is unknown, the appropriate resident school district must be identified and the child must be enrolled in that district prior to the placement of the child, except in emergency situations; (2) for a child with an out-of-state resident district whose out-of-state resident district has refused to enroll the child in the district, despite being contacted by both the nonpublic school within the applicable facility and the State Board of Education, the resident district shall be the student's most recent resident district in Illinois and that resident district shall be the responsible payee; and (3) the equivalent of each applicable child's tuition receipts for the 2025-2026 school year shall be paid to the resident district. Makes other changes. Effective immediately."
