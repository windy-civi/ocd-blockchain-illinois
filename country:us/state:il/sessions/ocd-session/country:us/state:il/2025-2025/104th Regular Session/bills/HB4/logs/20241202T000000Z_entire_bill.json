Requires the Department of Healthcare and Family Services to conduct a study on managed care pharmacy access standards. Provides that the study shall review the current access standards, with a focus on disproportionately impacted areas. Requires the Department to seek input from consumers of pharmacy services. Requires the Department to report its findings to the Governor and the General Assembly by January 1, 2026 and to publish the report on the Department's website. Provides that any retail pharmacy that is enrolled as an eligible retail pharmacy provider in the medical assistance program and is not sanctioned under investigation for fraud, waste, or abuse shall provide retail pharmacy services to any medical assistance recipient who resides in the same zip code as the pharmacy, regardless of whether the retail pharmacy is contracted to provide pharmacy services for the managed care organization that the recipient is enrolled with. Requires the managed care organization to pay the retail pharmacy the managed care organization's standard contractual rate. Effective immediately."
