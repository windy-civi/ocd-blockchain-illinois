      "abstract": "Amends the Environmental Protection Act. Provides that a food dispensing establishment may provide single-use foodware only upon the request of a customer or at a self-service station. Specifies that food dispensing establishments shall provide options for customers to affirmatively request single-use foodware when ordering food and beverages for delivery or take-out across all ordering or point of sale platforms, including internet-enabled applications, digital platforms, phone orders, and in-person ordering. Exempts certain types of foodware and certain types of facilities from the provisions of the amendatory Act. Provides that the owner or operator of a food service establishment that violates these provisions is to be assessed a civil penalty. Directs civil penalties imposed for violations of these provisions to be deposited into the Solid Waste Management Fund for use by the Agency for the purposes of expanding and funding climate-related programs and pollution-related programs. Makes other changes."
