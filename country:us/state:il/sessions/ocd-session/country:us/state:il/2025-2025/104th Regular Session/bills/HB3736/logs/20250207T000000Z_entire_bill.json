Provides that any person who is harmed by the unlawful sale, distribution, promotion, or exhibition of obscene material may bring a civil action against the individual or entity responsible for the violation. Provides that the prevailing plaintiff in a civil action under this provision may be entitled to compensatory damages for actual damages suffered as a result of the obscenity violation. Provides that, in addition to compensatory damages, the plaintiff may recover punitive damages as determined by the court. Provides that damages shall not exceed $10,000,000 for each count in the civil action, with each separate instance of unlawful sale, distribution, promotion, or exhibition of obscene material constituting a separate count. Provides that a civil action for obscenity violations under this provision must be brought within 5 years of the discovery of the violation or the harm caused by the violation. Provides that, in any successful civil action, the plaintiff may be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees in addition to the damages awarded. Provides that a court may grant injunctive relief to prevent further violations of this provision, including the cessation of the sale, distribution, or exhibition of obscene material by the defendant. Provides that the civil action may be brought in the county where the defendant resides, where the unlawful sale, distribution, promotion, or exhibition occurred, or where the plaintiff resides, if applicable."
