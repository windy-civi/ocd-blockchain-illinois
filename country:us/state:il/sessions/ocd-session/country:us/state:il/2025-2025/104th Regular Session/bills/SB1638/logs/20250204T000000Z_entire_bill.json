Modifies the definition of \"criminal offense\" for the purposes of the Act to include, among other things, an arrest under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act. Provides that a petitioner may petition the circuit court to expunge the records of the petitioner's arrests and charges not initiated by arrest when each arrest or charge not initiated by arrest sought to be expunged resulted in, among other things, extradition to another state under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act. Provides that a court may not consider an outstanding legal financial obligation established, imposed, or originated by a court, law enforcement agency, or a municipal, State, county, or other unit of local government when ruling upon a petition to seal criminal records of adults and minors prosecuted as adults."
