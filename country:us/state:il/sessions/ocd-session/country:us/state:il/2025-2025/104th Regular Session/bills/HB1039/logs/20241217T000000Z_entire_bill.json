      "abstract": "Creates the Public Official Body Camera Act. Provides that the State Board of Elections shall develop rules for the use of body cameras by public officials of the State. Specifies requirements concerning the use of body cameras. Provides that recordings made with the use of a body camera worn by a public official are subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act only to the extent recordings or portions of recordings are responsive to the request. Provides that the recordings may be used as evidence in any administrative, judicial, legislative, or disciplinary proceeding. Provides that, if a court or other finder of fact finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a recording was intentionally not captured, destroyed, altered, or intermittently captured in violation of the Act, then the court or other finder of fact shall consider or be instructed to consider that violation in weighing the evidence, unless the State or public official provides a reasonable justification. Makes conforming changes to the Freedom of Information Act."
