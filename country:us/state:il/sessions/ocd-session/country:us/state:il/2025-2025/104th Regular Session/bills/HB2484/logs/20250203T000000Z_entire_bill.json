      "abstract": "Amends the Downstate Police and Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund (IMRF) Articles of the Illinois Pension Code. Removes language providing that a person may not elect to participate in IMRF with respect to his or her employment as a chief of police of a participating municipality, unless that person became a participating employee in IMRF before January 1, 2019. Makes conforming changes. In the Downstate Police Article, provides that, on and after the effective date of the amendatory Act, a municipality is not required to establish a defined contribution plan. Provides that a municipality is required to maintain a defined contribution plan for persons who began participating in the defined contribution plan before the effective date of the amendatory Act. In provisions authorizing certain police officers to elect to participate in the defined contribution plan, restricts participation to police officers who first became police officers before the effective date of the amendatory Act and to municipalities that established a defined contribution plan before the effective date of the amendatory Act. Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement."
