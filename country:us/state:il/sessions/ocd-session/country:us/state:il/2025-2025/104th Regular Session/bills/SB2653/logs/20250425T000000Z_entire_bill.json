      "abstract": "Amends the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and Persons with Disabilities Act. Provides that the Business Enterprise Program shall (currently, may) establish uniform standards for calculating contract specific Business Enterprise Program goals for all State contracts and State construction contracts subject to the Act. Removes language providing that the dollar amount of certain contracts is defined by the Secretary of the Business Enterprise Council for Minorities, Women, and Persons with Disabilities and approved by the Council. Provides that the Business Enterprise Council for Minorities, Women, and Persons with Disabilities may permit, on its own initiative, an entire class of contracts to be exempt from State contracting goals for businesses owned by minorities, women, and persons with disabilities if there has been a written determination that there is an insufficient number of qualified businesses owned by minorities, women, and persons with disabilities to ensure adequate competition and an expectation of reasonable prices on bids or proposals within the class. Makes changes concerning deficiencies in utilization plans that may be cured."
