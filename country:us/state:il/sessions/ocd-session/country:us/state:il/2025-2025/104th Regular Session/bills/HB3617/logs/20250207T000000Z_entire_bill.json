      "abstract": "Amends the Counties Code and the Illinois Municipal Code. Provides that a law enforcement officer may not be required to issue a specific number of citations within a designated period of time or be required to meet an arrest quota (rather than a law enforcement officer may not be required to issue a specific number of citations within a designated period of time). Defines \"arrest quota\". Modifies and adds criterion that may be used to evaluate a law enforcement officer. Provides that a person or exclusive bargaining representative who is or whose members are aggrieved by a violation of the provisions may bring a civil action in an appropriate circuit court for declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the violation. Provides that, if the person or the exclusive bargaining representative is the prevailing party, the court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney's fees and costs and additional relief the court deems appropriate. Provides that enforcement of the provisions in circuit court does not affect a right or remedy available under any other law of this State. Makes other changes."
