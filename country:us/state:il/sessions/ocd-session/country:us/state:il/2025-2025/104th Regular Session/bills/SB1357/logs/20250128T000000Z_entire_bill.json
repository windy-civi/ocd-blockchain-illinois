      "abstract": "Amends the Freedom of Information Act. Provides that an elected official of a unit of local government shall not use an alias, false identity, or any other deceptive means to submit a request for public records under the Act if the intent of the request is to cause the unit of local government to incur unreasonable or excessive costs. Sets forth penalties for a violation of this prohibition. Provides that, if an elected official of a unit of local government submits a request or series of requests resulting in unreasonable or excessive costs and if the use of an alias or false identity is discovered, then there is a rebuttable presumption that the request or requests were made to cause the unit of local government to incur unreasonable or excessive costs. Authorizes a unit of local government to seek reimbursement from elected officials who violate this requirement. Authorizes the Attorney General, in coordination with units of local government, to investigate alleged violations and to take appropriate legal action against persons it alleges to have committed violations."
