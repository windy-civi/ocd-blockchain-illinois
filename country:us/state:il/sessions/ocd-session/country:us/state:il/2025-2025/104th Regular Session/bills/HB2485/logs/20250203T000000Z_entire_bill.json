      "abstract": "Amends the Liquor Control Act of 1934. In a provision requiring certain licensees to file a bond with the Department of Revenue, provides an exception for a manufacturer or importing distributor who is applying for a manufacturer's or importing distributor's license for the first time. Provides that the bond may be required as a condition to renew a license for subsequent annual license terms if a manufacturer or importing distributor exceeds $50,000 in tax liability. Provides that the Illinois Liquor Control Commission shall not renew a license for any applicant for a manufacturer's or importing distributor's license if the State Commission has received a notification from the Department showing that the applicant is required to file and has not filed a satisfactory bond with the Department and that the bond has not been approved by the Department. Removes language providing that the State Commission shall not issue a license to any applicant for a manufacturer's or importing distributor's license unless the Commission has received a notification from the Department showing that such applicant has filed a satisfactory bond with the Department and that such bond has been approved by the Department."
