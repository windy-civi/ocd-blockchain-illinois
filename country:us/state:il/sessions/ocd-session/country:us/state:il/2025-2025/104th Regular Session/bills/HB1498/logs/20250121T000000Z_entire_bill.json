      "abstract": "Amends the Election Code. Provides that the county clerk of a county where a decedent last resided shall (rather than may) issue certifications of death records from the electronic reporting system for death registrations and shall (rather than may) use that system to cancel the registration of any person who has died during the preceding month. Requires a county coroner, medical examiner, or physician for a county or any other individual responsible for certification of death under the Vital Records Act to promptly transmit certified records to the county clerk within 7 days after the death. Requires the county clerk and coroner to report quarterly to its affiliated county board and certify its full compliance with the provisions and accuracy of the voter rolls. Allows an individual to request a copy of the county clerk's or coroner's report and allows for relief if the county clerk fails to provide an accurate report within specified timeframes. Prohibits a political committee from making expenditures for payments to attorneys, expert witnesses, investigators, or others to provide a defense in a criminal case. Amends the Attorney General Act. Creates an Office of Election Integrity within the Office of the Attorney General. Provides that the purpose of the Office is to aid the State Board of Elections in completion of its duties under the Election Code. Provides that the Office shall develop and create a voter fraud hotline within 90 days after the effective date of the amendatory Act. Provides that by January 15 of each year, the Office shall submit a report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives detailing information on investigations of alleged election law violations or election irregularities conducted during the prior calendar year."
