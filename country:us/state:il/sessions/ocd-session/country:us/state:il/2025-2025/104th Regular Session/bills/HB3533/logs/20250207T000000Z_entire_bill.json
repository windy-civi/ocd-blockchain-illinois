      "abstract": "Creates the Professional Licensure Apprenticeship Recognition Act. Provides that the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation shall grant a license to any applicant who has: (1) completed a qualifying licensure apprenticeship program; (2) passed any examination required by the applicable licensing Act; (3) paid any applicable fees; and (4) met any other criteria unrelated to training and education requirements under the licensing Act. Sets forth provisions concerning the denial of an apprenticeship program, the determination of a passing score on a licensing examination, and licensing fees. Provides that the Department may work with relevant agencies, including the State Board of Education, the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, and the Department of Employment Security, to ensure that licensure apprenticeship programs that qualify under the Act are available and known to secondary and postsecondary students. Provides that the Department may consider licensure apprenticeship programs for professions that do not have a corresponding licensing Act as a path to licensure if, in the discretion of the Department, apprenticeship is appropriate. Provides that the Department shall not exempt a license obtained pursuant to the Act from any continuing training or education requirements required for license holders under the licensing Act to maintain or renew an existing license. Effective January 1, 2026."
