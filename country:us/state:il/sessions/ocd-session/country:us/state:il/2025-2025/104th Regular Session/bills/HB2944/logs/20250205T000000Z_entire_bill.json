Provides that for an extended hospital stay beyond medical necessity due to multiple failed attempts to place an emergency room patient who presented for dementia or other long-term care needs into a nursing or other long-term care facility, the Department of Healthcare and Family Services shall reimburse the hospital at a rate calculated to cover the entire hospital stay if (i) the hospital presents documentation, as prescribed by the Department, of multiple unsuccessful attempts to place the patient in a nursing or other long-term care facility and (ii) if each nursing or long-term care facility the hospital solicited for placement gave a substantially similar reason for denying the patient admission."
