Provides that, when an agency maintains a digital format record within a digital storage system that allows the user to set retention timers, these timers must be set to retain the record for its entire retention period as established by the State or Local Records Commission, including the time necessary for the record disposal process. Provides that agencies must comply with the provisions of the Act when destroying or disposing of encrypted public records or public records maintained in a digital format record within a digital storage system that allows the user to set retention timers.
