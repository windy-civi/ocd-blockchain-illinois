      "abstract": "Amends the Video Gaming Act. Provides that an applicant or licensee under the Act is not in violation of the Act or specified rules and shall not be subject to disciplinary action for operating a gaming device if operation of the gaming device is in compliance with and not considered gambling under the Criminal Code of 2012. Creates the Gaming Disparity Task Force to conduct a disparity and availability study. Provides that the Task Force shall compile, collect, or otherwise gather data necessary for the determination of the impact on minorities within the video gaming industry. Allows the Task Force to impose fees for the Task Force's operation collected by the Illinois Gaming Board on terminal operations that general more than $5,000,000, including for specified payments to a minority business enterprise-owed terminal operator. Amends the Criminal Code of 2012. Changes the definition of \"gambling device\" to include any vending or other electronic machine or device, including, without limitation, a machine or device that awards credits and contains a circuit, meter, or switch capable of removing and recording the removal of credits that is connected directly or indirectly to the Internet, either by cellular modem, hard wire, or wireless connection, or to a set of interconnected networked devices in order to participate in the game or contest or to receive or retrieve any data related to the device unless the connected device is a redemption vault and does not operate with a self-contained fill system that permits the operation of the device solely determined on a fee basis or the amount of revenue generated, but does not include a system based on time, number of spins or spin equivalent, or other nonrevenue based system, and automatically ceases to operate upon the completion of a pre-determined cycle. Provides that participants in a game of skill or chance where money or other things of value can be won but no payment or purchase is required to participate shall not be convicted of gambling except where participation in such game of skill or chance is accomplished using a gambling device prohibited by law. Provides that a gambling offense involving such a gambling device is a Class 4 felony. Effective immediately."
