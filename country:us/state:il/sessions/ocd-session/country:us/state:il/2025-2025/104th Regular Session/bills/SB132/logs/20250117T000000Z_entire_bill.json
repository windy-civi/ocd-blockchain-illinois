      "abstract": "Creates the Plastic Bottle Cap Reduction Act. Provides that, beginning January 1, 2029, a manufacturer may not sell, offer for sale, or distribute for sale in the State a single-use plastic beverage container with a plastic beverage cap unless the plastic beverage cap is composed of a plastic resin with the same resin identification code as the single-use plastic beverage container and the cap either (1) is tethered to the container in a manner that prevents the separation of the cap from the container when the cap is removed or (2) includes an opening from which the beverage can be consumed while the cap remains screwed onto or otherwise affixed to the container. Provides that a manufacturer that produces single-use plastic beverage containers shall provide to the Environmental Protection Agency upon request all information necessary for the Agency to determine the manufacturer's compliance with the Act. Provides for an entity with a legally recognized corporate relationship to a manufacturer to assume the manufacturer's responsibilities under the Act. Provides that the requirements of the Act do not apply to a manufacturer of beer, wine, or spirits that annually produces 50,000 gallons or less of any one or more of those products or to a manufacturer of beverages other than beer, wine, or spirits that annually produces 250,000 or fewer single-use plastic beverage containers containing its product. Provides that any person who violates any provision of the Act shall be liable for a civil penalty of $1,000 per violation per day. Authorizes the Attorney General or State's Attorney to prosecute violations of the Act. Defines terms."
