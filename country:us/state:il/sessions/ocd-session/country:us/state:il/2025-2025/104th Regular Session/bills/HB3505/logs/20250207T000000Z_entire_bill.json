      "abstract": "Amends the Environmental Protection Act. In provisions regarding ethylene oxide emissions from nonnegligible ethylene oxide emissions sources, adds requirements for an Ambient Air Monitoring Plan that substantially mirror requirements in provisions regarding ethylene oxide emissions from ethylene oxide sterilization sources. Changes the definition of \"nonnegligible ethylene oxide emissions source\" to any ethylene oxide emissions source permitted by the Agency that currently emits more than 30 pounds of ethylene oxide, with certain other requirements (rather than an ethylene oxide emissions source permitted by the Agency that currently emits more than 150 pounds of ethylene oxide, with certain other requirements). Removes a provision in that definition that excludes facilities that are ethylene oxide sterilization sources or hospitals that are licensed under the Hospital Licensing Act or operated under the University of Illinois Hospital Act."
