      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act. Provides that procedural requirements regarding the Governor taking possession of property for and on behalf of the State must take place in cases where the sum that the owner is willing to accept as just compensation is less than $25,000 (currently, $1,000). Provides that if the Governor issues a proclamation declaring a disaster, the Governor may extend the proclamation or make an additional proclamation regarding the same disaster, but the extension or additional proclamation shall be void and have no legal effect unless within 5 days of the extension or additional proclamation (i) he or she receives written approval to extend the proclamation or make an additional proclamation from 3 legislative leaders or (ii) the General Assembly adopts a joint resolution approving the extension or additional proclamation. Provides that a disaster proclamation issued, or a disaster proclamation regarding the same disaster, shall be void and have no legal effect if at any time the General Assembly adopts a joint resolution declaring the proclamation to be void. Provides that after a disaster proclamation is issued a member of the General Assembly may at any time file a request with the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate for a session to consider the proclamation if the request is signed by no fewer than 20 members of the General Assembly. Provides that upon such a filing, the House of Representatives and Senate shall convene within 5 calendar days and vote on a resolution declaring the proclamation void."
