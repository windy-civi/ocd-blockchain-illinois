      "abstract": "Amends the Child Care Act of 1969. Directs the Department of Children and Family Services to amend its rules establishing licensing standards for group day care homes to provide a revised maximum authorized extended capacity for group day care homes that is applicable through July 1, 2027. Provides that the revised maximum extended capacity rules adopted by the Department shall, at a minimum, allow one caregiver and 2 assistants to have the option of caring for 2 additional children who are 30 months of age or older, as well as 2 additional children who are attending school full-time, notwithstanding any other provision of the Act. Requires the revised rules not only to provide that the second full-time assistant shall be present at all times when there are more than 12 children in the home, but also to prohibit the total capacity of the group day care home from exceeding 16 children. Effective immediately."
