      "abstract": "Creates the Pharmacy Accountability and Access Act. Requires any owner of a pharmacy licensed under the Pharmacy Practice Act to provide written notice to specified governmental authorities no later than 180 calendar days before any pharmacy may be closed. Provides that the notice shall be physically posted at the affected location and prominently posted on the company's website for the entire 180-day period. Requires a report detailing the justification for closure, including any documentation of financial losses, operational inefficiencies, or how closure would otherwise align with the social responsibility commitments of the corporation. Sets forth provisions concerning public meetings, community transition plans, and repayment of tax incentives, subsidies, and other financial benefits provided to that pharmacy. Requires the Department of Public Health to review closures of pharmacies in medically underserved areas. Imposes penalties for failure to comply with the Act."
