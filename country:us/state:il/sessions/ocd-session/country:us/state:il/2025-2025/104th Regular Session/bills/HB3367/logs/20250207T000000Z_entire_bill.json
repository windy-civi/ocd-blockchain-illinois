      "abstract": "Amends the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Provides that in a prosecution of a case involving the injury, health, or safety of a cat or dog, the court may, on its own motion or motion of any party, appoint a licensed attorney-at-law of the State or a law student authorized to provide services under Supreme Court Rule 711 as a special advocate to assist the court, as deemed appropriate by the court, and represent the interests of justice regarding the health or safety of the cat or dog. Provides that the advocate may: (1) monitor the case; (2) consult any person with information that could aid the court and review records relating to the condition of the cat or dog and the defendant's actions, including, but not limited to, records from animal control officers, veterinarians, and police officers; (3) attend hearings; and (4) present information or recommendations to the court pertinent to determinations that relate to the interests of justice, provided that information shall be based solely on the duties undertaken under this provision. Provides that nothing in the amendatory Act shall be construed to alter the legal status of animals as a unique class of personal property."
