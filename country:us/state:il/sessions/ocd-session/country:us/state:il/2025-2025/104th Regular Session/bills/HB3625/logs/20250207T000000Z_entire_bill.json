      "abstract": "Amends the Criminal Code of 2012. Provides that it is unlawful for a child sex offender to knowingly reside within 250 (rather than 500) feet of a school building or the real property comprising any school that persons under the age of 18 attend, a playground, child care institution, day care center, part day child care facility, (deletes day care home and group day care home), or a facility providing programs or services exclusively directed toward persons under 18 years of age. Provides that nothing in these provisions prohibits a person subject to these provisions from residing within 250 feet of a school building or the real property comprising any school that persons under 18 attend, a playground, child care institution, day care center, part day care child care facility, or a facility providing programs or services exclusively directed toward persons under 18 years of age if the property was established as his or her current address of registration prior to the date that entity was opened, or if the entity must obtain a license in order to provide programs or services, the date that the license was issued. Provides that once a current property is established as the site of registration, nothing in these provisions prohibits a person subject to these provisions from continuing to reside at the property if the person's floor or unit number changes. Amends the Sex Offender Registration Act and the Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Registration Act. Deletes provisions that a person required to register under the respective Act who lacks a fixed residence must report weekly, in person, to the appropriate law enforcement agency where the sex offender is located. Makes other changes. Effective immediately."
