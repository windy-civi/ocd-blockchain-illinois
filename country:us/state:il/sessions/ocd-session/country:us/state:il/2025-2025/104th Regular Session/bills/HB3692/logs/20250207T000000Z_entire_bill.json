      "abstract": "Amends the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act. Provides that each applicant for the issuance or renewal (rather than only the issuance) of a Firearm Owner's Identification Card shall (rather than may) provide a full set of the applicant's fingerprints in electronic format to the Illinois State Police, unless the applicant has previously provided a full set of the applicant's fingerprints to the Illinois State Police under the Act or the Firearm Concealed Carry Act. Prohibits a live scan fingerprint vendor from charging more than $30 per set of fingerprints reviewed under the Act. Repeals a provision concerning a report that was to have been completed by January 1, 2022. Requires the Illinois State Police to deny the FOID card application of any person who fails to submit fingerprints. Changes the amounts of FOID card processing fees. Makes conforming changes in the Firearm Concealed Carry Act."
