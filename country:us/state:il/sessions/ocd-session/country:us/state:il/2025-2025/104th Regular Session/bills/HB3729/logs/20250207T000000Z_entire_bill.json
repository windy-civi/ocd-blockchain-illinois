      "abstract": "Amends the Video Gaming Act. Prohibits a terminal operator from compensating a sales agent and broker based on a percentage of the after-tax profits from a video gaming terminal, the net terminal income from a video gaming terminal or attributed to licensed establishments, or any other compensation metric based upon the performance of a video gaming terminal in various licensed establishments. Provides that a terminal operator shall not enter into any contract or agreement for the sharing, splitting, or payment of net terminal income with any other person. Prohibits any contract or agreement for the sharing, splitting, or payment of net terminal income with any other person executed before January 1, 2025 from being amended, modified, or extended. Allows a terminal operator to enter into a contract or agreement for the sharing, splitting, or payment of net terminal income with any other person if such contract is approved by the Illinois Gaming Board. Prohibits a sales agent and broker from giving anything of value to a current or potential licensed establishment. Prohibits a sales agent and broker that is not an owner of a terminal operator to solicit or procure a use agreement or any other contract or agreement that purports to control or authorize the placement or operation of a video gaming terminal on behalf of a terminal operator from a current or potential licensed establishment if that person is an immediate family member of a direct or indirect owner, officer, director, manager, employee, or a person who otherwise significantly influences or controls the licensed establishment. Provides that any use agreement currently authorizing the placement and operation of video gaming may continue as a valid and enforceable use agreement through the end of the current use agreement term, but shall not be amended, modified, extended, or renewed after the effective date of the amendatory Act. Prohibits a current or potential licensed establishment from accepting anything of value from a terminal operator or sales agent and broker as any incentive or inducement to locate video gaming terminals in that establishment and licensed establishments. Makes other changes."
