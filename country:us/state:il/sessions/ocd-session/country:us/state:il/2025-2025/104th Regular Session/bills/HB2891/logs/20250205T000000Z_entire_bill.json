      "abstract": "Amends the Water Commission Act of 1985. Provides that a commission may not receive more than $10,000 per year in compensation (currently a commission may not receive more than $10,000 per year in compensation except that no commissioner who is a member of the governing board or an officer or employee of the county or any unit of local government within the county may receive any compensation for serving as a commissioner). Allows a commission to use alternate project delivery methods, establish goals or requirements for the procurement of goods and services and for construction contracts, and accept assignment of municipal waterworks system contracts or other public improvement contracts. Gives commissions the authority to enter into design-build contracts and use a design-build delivery system. Includes definitions and requirements for the design-build delivery system. Amends the Illinois Municipal Code. Provides that a water commission may construct water transmission and distribution lines within a radius of 50 miles (rather than 25 miles) outside the corporate limits of member municipalities for the purpose of furnishing water to any additional entities which contract with the commission for a supply of water."
