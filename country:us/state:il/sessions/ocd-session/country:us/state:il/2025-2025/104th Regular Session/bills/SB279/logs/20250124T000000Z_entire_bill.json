Provides that upon petition, the court shall order that a person against whom an emergency order of protection was issued shall have all records related to the emergency order expunged (unless the person violated the order) from the court's records and from the Illinois State Police's Law Enforcement Agencies Data System if: (1) the person who sought the emergency order fails to seek a plenary order of protection before the emergency order expires; (2) there is an agreed dismissal; or (3) the court denies the issuance of a plenary order of protection following the emergency order.
