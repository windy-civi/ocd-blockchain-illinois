      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Housing Development Act. Requires the Illinois Housing Development Authority to establish and administer a Housing Hardship Program to provide up to 3 months of emergency rental or mortgage assistance or up to $1,600 per month for 3 months, whichever is less, to eligible applicants who demonstrate a hardship or other extenuating circumstances that place them at risk of eviction or foreclosure. Lists certain financial hardships that qualify for assistance under the program. Provides that applicants may apply for assistance once every 2 years regardless of household income. Requires applicants to submit a financial affidavit supported by banking statements and other documentary evidence as prescribed by the Authority. Requires the Authority to provide assistance to eligible applicants based upon the following factors in order of priority: (1) Whether the applicant has never previously received housing or public assistance from any other State or federal program. (2) If the applicant has previously received housing or public assistance, the number of times the applicant received such assistance. (3) The severity of the applicant's declared hardship or circumstances. Amends the State Finance Act. Creates the Housing Hardship Program Fund."
