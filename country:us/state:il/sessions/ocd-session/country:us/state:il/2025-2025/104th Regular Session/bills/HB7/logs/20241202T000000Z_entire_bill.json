      "abstract": "Amends the Unified Code of Corrections relating to certificates of expungement for Class 3 and 4 felonies. Eliminates the requirement that a certificate of expungement may only be issued to a person who has served in the United States Armed Forces or National Guard of this or any other state and had received an honorable discharge from the United States Armed Forces or National Guard or who at the time of filing the petition is enlisted in the United States Armed Forces or National Guard of this or any other state and served one tour of duty and who meets the requirements of this provision. Expands the offenses ineligible for a certificate of expungement to include offenses involving domestic violence as defined in the Protective Orders Article of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, including aggravated assault, aggravated battery, violation of an order of protection, domestic battery, or aggravated domestic battery. Amends the Criminal Identification Act. Provides that, notwithstanding the eligibility requirements of the expungement provisions, upon the issuance of a certificate of expungement by the Prisoner Review Board under the Unified Code of Corrections, the circuit court shall automatically expunge all records of arrests or charges not initiated by arrest and all court records that resulted in the conviction for the Class 3 or Class 4 felony listed in the certificate of expungement."
