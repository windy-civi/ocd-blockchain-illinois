Establishes the Health Care Funding Association for the primary purpose of equitably determining and collecting assessments for the cost of immunizations and health care information lines in the State that are not covered by other federal or State funding. Requires assessed entities, which include, but are not limited to, writers of individual, group, or stop-loss insurance, health maintenance organizations, third-party administrators, fraternal benefit societies, and certain other entities, to pay a specified quarterly assessment to the Association. Sets forth provisions concerning membership of the Association; powers and duties of the Association; methodology for calculating the assessment amount; reports and audits; immunities; tax-exempt status of the Association; an administrative allowance to the Department of Public Health; and other matters. Amends the State Finance Act to make conforming changes. Effective immediately."
