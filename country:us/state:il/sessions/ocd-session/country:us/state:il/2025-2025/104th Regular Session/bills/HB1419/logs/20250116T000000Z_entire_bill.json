      "abstract": "Amends the Department of Early Childhood Act. Provides that beginning on July 1, 2026, a preschool educational program funded by the Department of Early Childhood may admit children ages 3 to 5 who do not otherwise qualify for program services under the low income or at-risk criteria described under the Act if and only if open enrollment slots are available in the program after all reasonable efforts have been made to fill those slots with qualifying children. Provides that a preschool educational program that admits non-qualifying children must demonstrate, as prescribed by the Department, that it made all reasonable efforts to fill all enrollment slots with qualifying children. Provides that failure to demonstrate such efforts may result in a reduction in the grant amount awarded for the program. Effective July 1, 2026."
