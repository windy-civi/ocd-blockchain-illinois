      "abstract": "Creates the Domestic Violence Survivor Health Care Billing Act. Provides that a domestic violence survivor who is not the subscriber or primary policyholder of a health insurance plan may opt out of billing the health insurer for medical forensic services related to domestic violence if the domestic violence survivor provides a sworn statement or affidavit attesting to the domestic violence and any additional documentation to support the claim of domestic violence, which may include, but is not limited to, a police report, a protective order, or documentation from a domestic violence shelter or program that the health care practitioner may request. Provides that if the domestic violence survivor chooses to not have the health insurer billed, the health care practitioner shall instead submit the bill for the medical forensic services to the Department of Human Services for reimbursement through the Domestic Violence Prevention and Intervention Program or a similar program administered by the Department of Human Services. Provides that reimbursement may be provided regardless of when the incident of domestic violence occurred and is limited to medical forensic services that are directly related to an incident of domestic violence. Defines terms and sets forth provisions concerning rulemaking."
