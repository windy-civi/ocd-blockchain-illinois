      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Insurance Code. Provides that, when determining rates or premiums for certain automobile insurance policies, insurance issuers may not consider or otherwise use an individual's credit-based insurance score or age if the age of the insured is 50 years of age or more. Provides that a policy of automobile insurance, including any class of motor vehicle coverage, may not be canceled by the insurer solely because the insured has reached the age of 65 years so long as the insured has a valid Illinois driver's license. Prohibits an insurer from refusing to issue a renewal policy or increasing the premium for any policy solely because an insured has attained the age of 65 years or older. Prohibits providers of automobile insurance from considering any data obtained from applications on an insured's cellular phone or that may be installed, either at the time of manufacture or later, in the insured's motor vehicle for purposes of establishing premiums or rates with the express written consent of the insured. Prohibits providers from increasing rates or premiums on the basis that express written consent of the insured is withheld."
