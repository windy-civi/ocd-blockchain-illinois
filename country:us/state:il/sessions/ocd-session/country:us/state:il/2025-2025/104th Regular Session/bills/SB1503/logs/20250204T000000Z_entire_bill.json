      "abstract": "Amends the Workers' Compensation Act. Provides that, if a petitioner's claim is contested and enters arbitration proceedings, the Arbitrator shall include in its award pre-award interest at the rate of 6% per annum to a prevailing petitioner from the date of the contested injury, provided that no interest shall accrue if, within 12 months after the date of the injury, the respondent concedes that the claim is compensable. Provides that the non-prevailing party is responsible for any costs incurred in deposing a medical practitioner. Provides that all attorney's fees for representation of an employee or the employee's dependents shall be the responsibility of the non-prevailing employer (rather than only recoverable from compensation actually paid to such employee or dependents). Provides that, within 60 days after receipt of service of notice of preliminary proceedings before an Arbitrator, an employer shall disclose documents sufficient to calculate a petitioner's average weekly wage"
