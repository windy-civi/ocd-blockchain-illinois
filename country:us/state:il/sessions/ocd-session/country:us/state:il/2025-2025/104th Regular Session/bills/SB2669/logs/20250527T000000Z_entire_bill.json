Dissolves the Illinois African-American Family Commission.

Sets forth the members, terms, structure, Executive Director appointment, and staffing of the RISE Commission. Provides that the General Assembly shall appropriate at least $2,000,000 annually to support the operations and grantmaking functions of the RISE Commission. Allows the RISE Commission to receive and expend funds from federal and private sources. Requires the RISE Commission to: maintain a publicly accessible database of all projects and grants funded under its purview; submit an annual report to the General Assembly and the Governor on the allocation, use, and impact of funds; conduct an equity audit every 2 years; and develop an annual community investment scorecard rating agency performance. Repeals a provision regarding oversight of the RISE Commission.
