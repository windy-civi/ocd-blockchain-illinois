Provides that a law enforcement agency shall disclose a recording made with the use of an officer-worn body camera, upon request, to (i) the subject of the encounter captured on the recording, (ii) the legal representative of the subject of the encounter captured on the recording, (iii) the officer who wore the camera that made the recording, (iv) the legal representative of the officer who wore the camera that made the recording, (v) a person who has written permission from the subject of the encounter to receive the recording, or (vi) a person who has written permission from the officer who wore the camera that made the recording to receive the recording. Provides that all recordings made with an officer-worn body camera may (rather than must) be destroyed after 90 days, unless any encounter captured on the recording has been flagged. Makes changes to the definition of \"law enforcement officer\" in the Act. Amends the Eavesdropping Article to the Criminal Code of 2012. Provides that recordings made in accordance with the Law Enforcement Officer-Worn Body Camera Act are exempt from the Article. Effective immediately."
