Allows the local school board of each resident district to have an opportunity to negotiate with the charter school for a transfer of authorization prior to the State Board voting on the renewal proposal. Provides that authorization shall be transferred from the State Board to a local school board at the end of the charter term with the agreement of both the charter school and the local school board. Allows the State Board to adopt any rules necessary to implement the changes made by the amendatory Act."
