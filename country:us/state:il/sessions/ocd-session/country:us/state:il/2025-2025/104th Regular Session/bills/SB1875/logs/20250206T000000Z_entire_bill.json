      "abstract": "Amends the Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act. Provides that each targeted methamphetamine precursor package shall contain no more than 3,600 (rather than 3,000) milligrams of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, their salts or optical isomers, or salts of optical isomers. Deletes a provision which specifies that no retail distributor operating a pharmacy, and no pharmacist or pharmacy technician, shall knowingly distribute to a single person more than 2 targeted packages in a single retail transaction. Amends the Methamphetamine Precursor Tracking Act. Provides that, on and after October 1, 2025, any manufacturer of products containing methamphetamine precursors sold in or brought into the State must, on a monthly basis, pay fees to the Central Repository. Provides that the Central Repository shall be responsible for setting the fee levels required. Provides that at the request of the Illinois State Police, manufacturers required to pay fees shall be required to provide written documentation demonstrating that they have paid such fees. Provides that the sale of methamphetamine precursors in or brought into the State by a manufacturer who has failed to pay fees required by the provision is guilty of a petty offense and subject to a fine of $500 for a first offense; $1,000 for a second offense occurring within 3 years of the first offense; and $5,000 for a third or subsequent offense occurring within 3 years of the prior offenses. Effective immediately."
