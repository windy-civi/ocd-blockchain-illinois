      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Lottery Law. Removes language providing that the Department of the Lottery shall publish each January in the Illinois Register a list of all game-specific rules, play instructions, directives, operations manuals, brochures, or other game-specific publications issued by the Department during the previous year and instructions concerning how the public may obtain copies of these materials from the Department. Removes provisions regarding the private manager. Provides that the Department shall make an effort to more directly inform players of the odds of winning prizes by publishing the information for all games on the Department's public website. Removes language providing that the effort to more directly inform players of the odds of winning prizes shall include the Department requiring all ticket agents to display a placard stating the odds of winning for each game offered by that agent. Provides that written play instructions shall be made available on the Department's public website or by the Department by request (rather than to all players through sales agents licensed to sell game tickets or shares). Removes language providing that moneys in the Department's account shall be deposited by the Department into the Public Treasurers' Investment Pool. Removes language providing that moneys from the Department's account may not be used to pay amounts to deferred prize winners. Allows the State Treasurer to act as an agent of the Department to perform financial functions. Removes language providing that the Director shall prepare and send to the State Comptroller vouchers requesting payment from the Deferred Lottery Prize Winners Trust Fund to deferred prize winners. Makes other changes."
