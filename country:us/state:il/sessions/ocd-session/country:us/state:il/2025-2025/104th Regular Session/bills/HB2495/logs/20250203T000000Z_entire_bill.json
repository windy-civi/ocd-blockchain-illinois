      "abstract": "Creates the Private Swimming Pool Enclosure Act which may be referred to as \"Zoe's Law\". Requires that new outdoor swimming pools on private residential property be enclosed by a fence, wall, or other effective permanent barrier of at least 42 inches in height with openings not more than 2 inches from the bottom to grade and not more than 4 inches within the wall, fence, or barrier. Provides that the provisions do not apply to above ground pools with a height of 42 inches or more or to jacuzzis. Permits more restrictive regulation by units of local government. Requires all municipalities to develop a permitting process for all swimming pools no later than 1/1/2026. Requires all permitted swimming pools to have enclosures inspected by the permitting municipality before the receipt of an initial permit and at least once every 5 years after that. Defines \"swimming pool\" for the purposes of the Act. Limits home rule powers. Makes conforming changes to the Counties Code and the Illinois Municipal Code."
