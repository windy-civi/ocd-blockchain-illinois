      "abstract": "Amends the School Code. Allows each school board to employ or accept as a volunteer a certified chaplain to provide to a school support, services, and programs for students, staff, and parents as assigned by the school board. Sets forth the selection process, certification requirements, and amount of chaplains a school may employ or accept as a volunteer. Requires a chaplain to submit to a fingerprint-based criminal history records check and check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database and the Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database before the chaplain begins employment or volunteering at a school. Prohibits a chaplain from being employed or accepted as a volunteer if the chaplain is registered or is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration Act or the Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Registration Act. Provides that no person shall have a cause of action against a chaplain for any action taken or statement made in adherence with the provision of support, services, or programs for students, staff, or parents. Establishes exceptions to a chaplain's liability immunity."
