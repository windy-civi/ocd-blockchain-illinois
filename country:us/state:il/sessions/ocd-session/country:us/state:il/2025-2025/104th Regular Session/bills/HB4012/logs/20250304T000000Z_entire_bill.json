      "abstract": "Amends the Video Gaming Act. Prohibits a home rule unit of local government with a population of over 1,000,000 from enforcing any local ordinance passed prior to the effective date of the amendatory Act prohibiting the operation of video gaming terminals within the corporate limits of the municipality. Removes a provision allowing for the use of a game device without a license if the game device is used in an activity that is not gambling under the Criminal Code of 2012. Prohibits a home rule unit of government with a population of over 1,000,000 from imposing any fee for the operation of a video gaming terminal in excess of $250 per year. Amends the Criminal Code of 2012. Changes the definition of \"gambling device\" to include any vending or other electronic machine or device, including, without limitation, a machine or device that awards credits and contains a circuit, meter, or switch capable of removing and recording the removal of credits that offers a person entry into any contest, competition, sweepstakes, scheme, plan, or other selection process that involves or is dependent upon an element of chance for which the person may receive a gift, award, or other item or service of value if that offer is incidental to or results from: (A) the purchase of an item or service of value; or (B) the purchase or gratuitous receipt of a coupon, voucher, certificate, or other similar credit that can be redeemed for or applied towards an item or service of value from such machine or device or elsewhere. Provides that participants in a game of skill or chance where money or other things of value can be won but no payment or purchase is required to participate shall not be convicted of gambling except where participation in such game of skill or chance is accomplished using a gambling device prohibited by these changes to the definition. Provides that a gambling offense involving such a gambling device is a Class 4 felony. Effective immediately."
