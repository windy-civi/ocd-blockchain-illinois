      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act. Makes changes to the definition of \"managerial employee\", including that, unless the sheriff and the union have mutually agreed otherwise, or are already recognized by the Act, the \"undersheriff\", \"chief deputy\", or \"superintendent of the jail\" shall be defined as a managerial employee. In the definition of \"supervisor\", provides that that the term includes only those individuals who devote a preponderance of their employment time to exercising that authority, State supervisors and sworn State police officers notwithstanding. In the definition of \"supervisor\", also provides that the Illinois Labor Relations Board, or the relevant panel with jurisdiction, shall consider, as evidence of bargaining unit inclusion or exclusion, applicable civil service law, ordinances, personnel codes, provisions regarding boards of fire and police commissioners in the Illinois Municipal Code, and the Sheriff's Merit System Law."
