      "abstract": "Creates the Municipal Home Rule Charter Act. Provides that any home rule municipality with a population over 500,000 people may adopt a charter to govern municipal affairs. Provides that a charter shall be its organic law. Provides that a charter must be consistent with the Illinois Constitution and U.S. Constitution. Provides that, unless a State law specifically applies to home rule or charter municipalities, language in charters shall be considered supreme when in conflict with a State law. Provides that a qualifying municipality may create a charter commission by a vote of two-thirds vote of the entire legislative body of the municipality. Provides that, within one year of the first organizing meeting of the commission, the commission shall prepare a charter to be approved by a majority of commissioners. Provides that, upon adoption of a charter by the charter commission, it shall go before voters at the next regular general election. Provides that, upon receiving 60% of the vote, the charter is considered adopted. Provides that, if the charter fails, then the process is dead and a municipal legislative body must pass a new ordinance for a new commission in order to adopt a charter. Provides that, if the charter commission fails to adopt a charter, then the commission shall expire."
