Removes a provision providing that if the determination is made that a standardbred stallion is not owned by a resident of the State of Illinois or that a transfer of ownership is a subterfuge to qualify a standardbred stallion under the Act, or that a standardbred stallion owner, manager, or person associated with him or her has knowingly participated in the arrangements for transporting semen from a standardbred stallion registered under the Act out-of-state, the Director of the Department of Agriculture or his authorized agent shall immediately publish notice of such fact in publications devoted to news concerning standardbred horses. Effective immediately."
