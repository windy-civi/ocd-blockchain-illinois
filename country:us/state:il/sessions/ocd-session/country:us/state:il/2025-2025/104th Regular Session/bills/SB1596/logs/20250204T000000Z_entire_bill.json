      "abstract": "Amends the Environmental Protection Act. In a provision regarding prohibited acts, provides that no person shall operate a commercial wind energy facility in a manner that causes, threatens, or allows the release of oil, lubricant, hydraulic fluid, transformer solvent, insulation fluid, cleaning fluid, or any other similar fluid from the commercial wind energy facility. Requires any fluid released in violation of this prohibition to be remediated. Provides that any person who violates this prohibition shall, for each day of violation, be liable for a civil penalty of $1,000 for a first offense and $10,000 for a second or subsequent offense. Provides for a 100% reduction in penalty for a person who self-discloses noncompliance with this provision. Directs the owner or operator of a commercial wind energy facility to annually register with the Agency in the form and manner prescribed by the Agency. Specifies that the owners and operators of a commercial wind energy facility have an affirmative duty to cover all remediation and response expenses that are incurred as a result of the operation of a commercial wind energy facility in a manner that causes, threatens, or allows the release of oil, lubricant, hydraulic fluid, transformer solvent, insulation fluid, cleaning fluid, or any other similar fluid. Grants the Agency rulemaking powers."
