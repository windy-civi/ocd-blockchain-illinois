      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Insurance Code. Provides that any health insurance issuer carrying on business in this State on or after January 1, 2027 shall develop a plan to provide adequate coverage of and access to a broad spectrum of pain management services, including, but not limited to, nonopioid, nonnarcotic medication for pain management and nonmedication pain management services that serve as alternatives to the prescribing of opioid or narcotic drugs in accordance with guidelines that will be developed by the Department of Insurance. Provides that the Department shall review the plans and consider the adequacy of access to a broad spectrum of pain management services under the issuers plans and whether any policies adopted by the issuer may create unduly preferential coverage of and access to prescription opioids for pain management, without consideration of other pain management services. Provides that Any health insurance issuer carrying on business in the State of Illinois shall distribute educational materials to participating providers about any pain management access plan and post information about the plan on the issuer's publicly accessible website. Amends the State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971, the Counties Code, the Illinois Municipal Code, the School Code, the Health Maintenance Organization Act, the Limited Health Service Organization Act, the Voluntary Health Services Plans Act, and the Illinois Public Aid Code to require coverage under those provisions."
