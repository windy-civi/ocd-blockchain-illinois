Provides that the lease of real estate is permitted when a property, structure, or facility owned by Kane County can be used for athletic purposes in the interest of the public or for the benefit and enjoyment of residents of the county if the property, structure, or facility acquired by Kane County was being used for athletic purposes prior to the county acquiring the property, structure, or facility. For leases entered into under this provision after the effective date of the amendatory Act, the lease must require (i) the lessee to allow any organization that used the land at the time the lease is executed to continue to use the land for the leased purposes during the term of the lease and (ii) the lessor to continue, during the term of the lease, to employ, in the same capacity, any persons who provided services on the land at the time the lease is executed."
