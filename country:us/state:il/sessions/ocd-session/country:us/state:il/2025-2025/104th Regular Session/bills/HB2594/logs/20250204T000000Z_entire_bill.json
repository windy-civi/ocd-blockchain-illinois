      "abstract": "Amends the Courses of Study Article of the School Code. Instead of requiring consumer education to be taught and studied, provides that, beginning with pupils entering the 9th grade in the 2028-2029 school year, pupils in the public schools in grade 11 or 12 shall be taught and be required to complete a stand-alone, one-semester or equivalent course covering personal finance. Sets forth what topics must be included. Provides that the State Board of Education shall devise or approve the personal finance education standards for the course. Provides that the school board shall oversee implementation of the course for each high school student prior to graduation. Provides that the State Board of Education shall establish a Financial Literacy Implementation Committee no later than June 30, 2025 to make recommendations to the State Superintendent of Education concerning the implementation of the course for each high school student prior to graduation. Sets forth provisions concerning Committee members, meetings, and support. Provides that the State Board of Education shall present regular and timely reports to the Committee regarding the implementation of the course. Requires a pupil to successfully complete a course on personal finance education as a prerequisite to receiving a high school diploma (rather than allowing a financial literacy course to be included as part of the social studies requirement). Makes other changes. Effective immediately."
