Requires medical care providers prescribing psychotropic drugs to children under the State's Medicaid program to provide FDA Medication Guides to parents or legal guardians before issuing a prescription. Provides that the Medication Guides must be printed and reviewed with the parent or legal guardian, explaining (1) FDA-identified risks of the medication, including pediatric-specific warnings and (2) signs of potential side effects and adverse drug reactions detailed in the Medication Guide. Provides that written informed consent must be obtained from the parent or legal guardian before prescribing a psychotropic drug. Requires the Department of Healthcare and Family Services to, within 12 months after the effective date of the Act, develop and maintain a secure online reporting system for adverse drug reactions related to psychotropic drugs prescribed to children and adolescents. Contains provisions on adverse drug reaction reporting requirements; legislative oversight and reviews of adverse drug reaction reports related to psychotropic drugs; penalties for medical care providers who fail to comply with medication guide distribution; transparency and accountability reporting requirements for the Department of Healthcare and Family Services; and other matters.
