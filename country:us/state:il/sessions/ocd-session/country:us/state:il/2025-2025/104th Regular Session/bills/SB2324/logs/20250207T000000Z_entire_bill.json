      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Vehicle Code. Provides that if a person is convicted of running a red light, disobeying a stop sign, failing to obey a yield sign, or disobeying or avoiding a traffic control device and such action is determined to be the approximate cause of seriously bodily harm or death to another person, the person shall be subject to a fine of no less than $1,000 and no more than $5,000. Provides that when assessing the amount of the fine, the judge may take into account mitigating factors, including, but not limited to, acceptance of responsibility by the defendant, if any restitution or insurance was paid to the victim, whether the defendant poses a risk to public safety, undue hardship, total fault of each party, and any other mitigating factors the judge deems necessary."
