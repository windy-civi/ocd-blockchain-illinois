Provides that nothing in provisions prohibiting the payment or acceptance of rebates shall prevent the offer or provision by insurers or producers, by or through employees, affiliates, or third-party representatives, of value-added products or services at no or reduced cost when such products or services are not specified in the policy of insurance, so long as the product or service relates to the insurance coverage and is primarily designed to satisfy specified criteria. Sets forth provisions concerning the requirements for insurers or producers offering non-cash gifts, items, or services or conducting raffles or drawings. Provides that an insurer, producer, or representative of an insurer or producer may not offer or provide insurance as an inducement to the purchase of another policy or otherwise use the words \"free\", \"no cost\", or words of similar import in an advertisement."
