      "abstract": "Amends the Sports Wagering Act. Provides that, if a public entity that owns a sports facility does not apply for a master sports wagering license, a professional sports team that (i) plays the majority of its home contests at the sports facility and (ii) has received written authorization from the public entity may apply to the Illinois Gaming Board for a master sports wagering license in place of the public entity and shall be deemed to be a sports facility for the purposes of the Act. Requires a professional sports team granted a license under the provisions to operate through a designee. Sets the initial license fee for a master sports wagering license for a professional sports team at $1,000,000, but adjusts the amount 12 months after the professional sports team licensee begins sportsbook operations based on 5% of its handle from the first 12 months of sportsbook operations. Provides that the master sports wagering license is valid for 4 years. Allows the Board to adopt rules necessary to implement the provisions."
