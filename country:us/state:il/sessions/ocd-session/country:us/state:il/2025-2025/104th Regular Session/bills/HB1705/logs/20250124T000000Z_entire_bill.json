      "abstract": "Amends the School Code. Requires each school board to implement, not later than July 1, 2026, a mobile panic alert system capable of connecting disparate emergency services technologies to ensure real-time coordination between local and State law enforcement and first responder agencies. Provides that the system shall be known as \"Alyssa's Alert\" and shall integrate with local, public-safety, answering-point infrastructure to transmit 9-1-1 calls and mobile activations. Allows a school board to implement additional strategies or systems to ensure real-time coordination between multiple first responder agencies in the event of a school security emergency. Provides that a school board is not required to procure or implement new or additional capabilities if, as of July 1, 2025, the school board has already implemented a mobile panic alert system with capabilities that meet system requirements. Requires the State Board of Education to conduct market research not later than December 1, 2025 to identify whether an existing competitively procured source of supply is available for a mobile panic alert system from multiple vendors for use by school districts. Provides that if no existing source of supply exists, then the State Board shall issue a competitive solicitation for such source of supply no later than January 1, 2026. Effective immediately."
