      "abstract": "Amends the Criminal Code of 2012 and the Unified Code of Corrections. Provides that certain offenses for which the use of a firearm requires the court to add 15 years, 20 years, or 25 years or up to a term of natural life to the sentence, makes the additional sentences discretionary with the court. Deletes provisions that permit the court in those cases to impose a term of natural life imprisonment upon the defendant. Provides that the court may impose the additional sentences only if the defendant was personally armed with the firearm and was personally displaying the firearm. Provides that the penalty for aggravated criminal sexual assault in which the defendant personally discharged the firearm in the commission of the offense is a Class X felony for which up to 20 years may (rather than 20 years shall) be added to the term of imprisonment imposed by the court and up to 25 years may be added (rather than 25 years or up to a term of natural life imprisonment shall be added) to the term of imprisonment imposed by the court if the discharge proximately caused great bodily harm, permanent disability, permanent disfigurement, or death to another person; Provides that the penalty for home invasion is a Class X felony for which up to 20 years may (rather than 20 years shall) be added to the term of imprisonment imposed by the court if the defendant personally discharged a firearm during the commission of the offense."
