      "abstract": "Amends the Downstate Teacher Article of the Illinois Pension Code. Provides that school districts that offer a 457(b) plan through a single vendor may use their single-vendor plan to satisfy the requirements of Public Act 102-540. Limits the number of school districts that may use their single-vendor plan to 10% of school districts statewide. Sets forth requirements for a single-vendor plan. Provides that when choosing a single vendor for the pilot program, the overriding consideration with respect to all decisions made by the plan sponsor concerning the plan is that the decisions be made solely in the best interests of the plan's participants and beneficiaries. Sets forth other requirements for the single-vendor plan. Provides that no vendor may offer a plan under the provisions if an individual employed by, compensated by, or working for that vendor offers or gives anything of value to any employee who participates in the selection of the 457(b) plan vendor in the school district. Provides that an employee who participates in the selection of the single vendor must avoid outside business interests with any vendor chosen or under consideration for being chosen for the school district; disclose all outside business interests with a vendor chosen or under consideration for being chosen for the school district; not accept any gifts, preferential treatment, or benefits that might affect or appear to affect his or her ability to make sound judgments on selection of a vendor; act honestly and ethically in the best interests of the plan participants in all dealings with chosen vendor; and not obtain employment with any vendor chosen or in consideration for being chosen to offer a plan at the school district for the duration of an interested party's employment or involvement with the school district for a period of one year thereafter. Specifies that the provisions are inoperable on and after January 1, 2031."
