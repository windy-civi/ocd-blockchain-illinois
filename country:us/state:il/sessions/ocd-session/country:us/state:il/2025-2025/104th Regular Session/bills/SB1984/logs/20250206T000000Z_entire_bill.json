      "abstract": "Amends the Uniform Electronic Transactions in Dental Care Billing Act. Provides that beginning January 1, 2028 (instead of 2026), no dental plan carrier is required to accept from a dental care provider eligibility for a dental plan transaction or dental care claims or equivalent encounter information transaction. Sets forth exemptions from the requirements of the Act, and requires a dental care provider who is exempt from the requirements of the Act to file a form with the Department of Insurance indicating the applicable exemption. Requires each dental plan carrier to establish a portal that provides certain benefit and billing information. Requires a dental plan carrier to establish an electronic portal that allows dental care providers to submit claims electronically and directly to the dental care provider; accept attachments in an electronic format with the initial electronic claim's submission; and provide remittance advice with the corresponding payment. Provides that nothing in the Act requires a dental care provider to only accept electronic payment from a dental plan carrier. Provides that dental plan carriers shall allow alternative forms of payment, without additional fees or charges, to a dental care provider, if requested. Effective immediately."
