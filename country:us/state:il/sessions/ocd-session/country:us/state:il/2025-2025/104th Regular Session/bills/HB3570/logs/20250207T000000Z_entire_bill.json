      "abstract": "Amends the Firearms Restraining Order Act. Requires the court or allows a State's Attorney to provide simplified forms and clerical assistance to help with the filing (rather than the writing and filing) of a petition for a firearms restraining order by any person not represented by counsel. Requires the clerk to immediately notify the State's Attorney of the filing of each firearms restraining order when it is filed. Gives the State's Attorney legal standing to represent any and all petitioners if the petitioners request the State's Attorney's assistance in filing the pleadings or in conducting the hearings. Requires a verified pleading (rather than an affidavit or verified pleading). Changes references to an intimate partner to references to a specific intimate partner. In provisions regarding ex parte hearings, requires the court to consider specific evidence and changes the burden of proof from probably cause to a preponderance of the evidence. Provides for the issuance of a plenary (rather than 6-month) firearms restraining order after a full hearing. Makes other changes."
