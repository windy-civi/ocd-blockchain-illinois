      "abstract": "Amends the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. In a provision which specifies that a person who is in police custody shall have the right, upon being taken into police custody, to communicate free of charge with an attorney of his or her choice and members of his or her family, deletes a provision that required that right to be provided as soon as possible upon being taken into custody. Provides that, if a person who is in police custody is transferred to a new place of detention, that person has a right to make one telephone call (rather than 3 telephone calls) within 3 hours of arrival. Specifies that this right is not renewable. Provides that the person in police custody is prohibited from contacting the alleged victim or victims of the offense for which the person is charged. Provides that statements that are made by a person who is detained in police custody in violation of the right to communicate provisions of the Code may be used to evaluate whether those statements were voluntarily given and are reliable, based on the totality of the circumstances. Authorizes a custodial arrest of a person accused of an offense that is not a felony or Class A misdemeanor if necessary to verify the accused's identity."
