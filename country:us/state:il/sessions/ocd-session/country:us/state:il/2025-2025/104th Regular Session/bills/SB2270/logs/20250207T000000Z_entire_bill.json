Provides that, beginning with the 2026-2027 school year, every public elementary school and high school shall include in its curriculum a unit of instruction studying the events of Latina and Latino history, including the history of Latinas and Latinos in Illinois and the Midwest, as well as the contributions of Latinas and Latinos toward advancing civil rights from the 19th century onward. Provides that these events shall include the contributions made by individual Latinas and Latinos in government and the arts, humanities, and sciences, as well as the contributions of Latina and Latino communities to the economic, cultural, social, and political development of the United States. Provides that the studying of this material shall constitute an affirmation by students of their commitment to respect the dignity of all races and peoples and to forever eschew every form of discrimination in their lives and careers. Establishes requirements for the State Superintendent of Education, regional superintendents, and each school board concerning instructional materials and guidelines. Permits a school to meet requirements through an online program or course."
