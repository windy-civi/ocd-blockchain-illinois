Provides that every civil claim or cause of action brought against any party alleging intentional or negligent acts or omissions by a person for physical, psychological, or other injury or condition suffered as a result of conduct which would constitute a sex offense under the Criminal Code of 2012 committed against a person who was 18 years of age or older, or incest committed against such person who was 18 years of age or older, which is barred as of the effective date of the amendatory Act because the applicable period of limitation has expired, is revived, and action thereon may be commenced not earlier than 6 months after, and not later than 18 months after the effective date of the amendatory Act."
