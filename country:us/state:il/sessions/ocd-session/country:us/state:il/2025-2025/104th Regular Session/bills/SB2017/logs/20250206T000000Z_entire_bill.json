      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Municipal Code. Prohibits municipal ordinances that regulate truants from including a fine or fee for violations or providing for enforcement by citation. Amends the School Code. Requires a memorandum of understanding between a local law enforcement agency and a school district for any school district that uses a school resource officer; sets forth requirements for the memorandum. Provides that a student is prohibited from being issued a monetary fine or fee by any person (rather than providing that a student may not be issued a monetary fine or fee) as a disciplinary consequence. Prohibits school personnel of a school district from referring a student to any other local public entity or a local law enforcement agency for that entity or agency to issue the student a monetary fine or fee as a disciplinary consequence. Prohibits a school district from referring a truant, chronic truant, or truant minor to any other local public entity for that local public entity to issue the child's parent or guardian a fine or a fee as punishment for the child's truancy. Makes conforming and other changes."
