Permits the Department of Health to adopt rules to set forth standards under which misuse of access may be reported to the Washington/Baltimore High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Overdose Detection Map or similar platform based on misuse or misconduct by a covered vehicle service provider or other individual or entity at the discretion of the Department. Provides that no data that allows for or creates a risk of identification of an individual or individuals experiencing a suspected or actual overdose treated by the covered vehicle service provider personnel shall be submitted to the Washington/Baltimore High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Overdose Detection Mapping Application or Similar technology platform. Provides that covered vehicle service provider personnel may report overdose surveillance through an identified technology platform for the use of overdose surveillance under exceptions to HIPAA and the reported data shall only be used to support public safety and public health efforts.
