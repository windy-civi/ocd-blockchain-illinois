      "abstract": "Amends the School Code. Removes language providing that a local program for the education of gifted and talented children may be approved for funding by the State Board of Education if funds for that purpose are available and if the local program submits an application for funds that includes a comprehensive plan. Removes language providing that the State Board of Education staff person in charge of educational programs for gifted and talented children shall be responsible for developing an approval process for educational programs for gifted and talented children. With respect to the evidence-based funding provisions, provides that in the adequacy target calculation, each organizational unit shall receive $40 per kindergarten through grade 12 for advanced academic programs (rather than for gifted investments). Makes related changes."
