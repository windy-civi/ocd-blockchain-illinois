      "abstract": "Amends the State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971. Provides that the eligibility of an annuitant or TRS benefit recipient to participate in the program of health benefits established under specified provisions of the Act shall not be suspended for any period during which he or she accepts employment from a school board or other employer in accordance with a provision of the Downstate Teacher Article of the Illinois Pension Code that allows annuitants to accept employment as a teacher without impairing retirement status if certain conditions are met, including a limit on the number of paid days the annuitant may work, or a provision for annuitants returning to teach in a subject shortage area. Provides that an annuitant or TRS benefit recipient shall not be deemed an active teacher based solely on the annuitant's or TRS benefit recipient's employment exceeding the limit on the number of paid days an annuitant may work without impairing retirement status. Amends the Downstate Teacher Article of the Illinois Pension Code to make conforming changes."
