      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Provides that any health care practitioner authorized by applicable law to issue prescriptions for Schedule II controlled substances shall, prior to issuing an initial prescription for a Schedule II controlled substance or any other opioid pain reliever during a course of treatment for acute or chronic pain shall discuss with the patient or the patient's parent or guardian, if the patient is under 18 years of age and is not an emancipated minor, the risks associated with the drugs being described. Provides that the discussion required by this provision shall take place before issuing an initial prescription, and again prior to issuing the third prescription during a course of treatment. Provides that the prescribing health care practitioner shall include a note in the patient's medical record that the patient or the patient's parent or guardian, as applicable, has discussed with the practitioner the risks of developing a physical or psychological dependence on the controlled dangerous substance and on alternative treatments that may be available. Provides that these provisions do not apply to prescriptions for a patient who is currently in an active treatment for cancer, receiving hospice care from a licensed hospice or palliative care provider, for a patient who is a resident of a long-term care facility, or to any medications being prescribed for use in the treatment of substance abuse or opioid dependence."
