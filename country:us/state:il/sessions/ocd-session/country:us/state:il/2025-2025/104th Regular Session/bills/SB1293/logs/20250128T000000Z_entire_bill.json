      "abstract": "Amends the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Provides that the warrant of arrest or summons shall command that the person against whom the complaint was made to be arrested and brought before the court issuing the warrant at a certain day, time, and courtroom number, or the nearest or most accessible court in the same county, or appear before the court at a certain time and place. Provides that if a person has a warrant in another county for an offense and the county where the warrant is outstanding fails to transport the person to the county where the warrant was issued for a hearing no later than 5 calendar days after the end of any detention issued on the charge in the arresting county, the county where the warrant is outstanding shall mark the warrant as served (rather than quash the warrant) and order the person released on the case for which the warrant was issued. Provides that if the issuing county fails to take any action within 5 calendar days, the defendant shall be released from custody on the warrant, and the circuit judge or associate circuit judge in the county of arrest shall set conditions of release and shall admit the defendant to pretrial release and shall schedule for his or her appearance before the court named in the warrant based upon the court day, time, and courtroom number listed on the warrant."
