      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Gambling Act. Requires the Illinois Gaming Board to conduct a survey to measure each operating casino license in the State regarding the adjusted gross receipts reported to the Board for the most recently concluded 12-month period within 12 months after the effective date of the amendatory Act. Requires the Board to submit a report to the Governor and the General Assembly listing all of the operating casino licenses, ranked by order of adjusted gross receipt productivity. Requires the Board to establish a request for proposals process to relocate the 3 lowest performing casinos based on the report in which a municipality or county may submit a proposal requesting the authorization to host one of the 3 lowest performing casino's license within the municipality or county. Provides that each owner or operator of a casino license subject to relocation has the right to relocate the casino to a new location as determined by the request for proposals process, and the relocation shall be completed no more than 5 years after the conclusion of the request for proposals process and selection of a new location. Provides that a provision regarding wagering taxes, rates and distribution applies to the adjusted gross receipts tax and its division by enumerated shares to enumerated eligible recipients subsequent to any relocation of a casino, and the share of the adjusted gross receipts, measured by percentage of the adjusted gross receipts, shall continue to be paid to the former host municipality or county by 2 times the amount the share of the adjusted gross receipts that had previously been paid to the former host municipality or county."
