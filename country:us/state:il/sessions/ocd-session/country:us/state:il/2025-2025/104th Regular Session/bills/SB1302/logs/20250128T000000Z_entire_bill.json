Amends the Illinois Act on the Aging. Requires the Department on Aging to implement and administer the Benefits Access Program and to establish the eligibility criteria under the program for: (1) the Secretary of State with respect to reduced fees paid by qualified vehicle owners under the Illinois Vehicle Code; (2) special districts that offer free fixed route public transportation services for qualified older adults under the Local Mass Transit District Act, the Metropolitan Transit Authority Act, and the Regional Transportation Authority Act; and (3) special districts that offer transit services for qualified individuals with disabilities under the Local Mass Transit District Act, the Metropolitan Transit Authority Act, and the Regional Transportation Authority Act. Sets forth household income eligibility limits and other eligibility requirements under the program. Authorizes the Department to adopt rules concerning automatic renewals and appeal rights under the program. Makes corresponding changes concerning the program to the Metropolitan Transit Authority Act, the Local Mass Transit District Act, the Regional Transportation Authority Act, the Illinois Public Aid Code, the Older Adult Services Act, and the Illinois Vehicle Code.
