      "abstract": "Amends the Mobile Home Landlord and Tenant Rights Act. Provides that a park owner shall notify a manufactured home owner in the park of a rent or fee increase if the increase is in excess of 3% above the current rent or in the Consumer Price Index, whichever is greater. Provides that if the rent or fee increase is greater than the percentage rate of rent in the Consumer Price Index, the park owner shall provide a written justification for the increase and make documentation available to all residents that shows the costs and commencement of work that justifies the rent or fee increase. Provides that in order for an increase in costs to justify such a rent or fee increase, for costs incurred for ordinary maintenance, property or real estate taxes, and utilities not directly paid by the manufactured home owner, the park owner must demonstrate that the work performed was necessary to meet the park owner's warranty of habitability obligations and demonstrate that the rent or fee increase imposed was no more than was necessary to cover the actual and reasonable cost of the work performed."
