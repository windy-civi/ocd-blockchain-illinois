In the Illinois Street Gang and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Law, expands the definition of \"predicate activity\" to include bribery, official misconduct, solicitation misconduct (State government), solicitation misconduct (local government), and legislative misconduct. Extends the repeal of the Illinois Street Gang and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Law to January 1, 2035 (rather than June 1, 2025). Amends the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Expands the authority of the State's Attorney to seek a court order authorizing the interception of a private communication when no party has consented to the interception and the interception may provide evidence of, or may assist in the apprehension of a person who has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense to include predicate activity under the Illinois Street Gang and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Law. Effective immediately."
