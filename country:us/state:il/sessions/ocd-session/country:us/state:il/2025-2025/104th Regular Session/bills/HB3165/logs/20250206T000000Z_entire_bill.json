      "abstract": "Amends the Open Meetings Act. Provides if a public body is a local school council organized under the Chicago School District Article of the School Code, then, subject to certain requirements, an open or closed meeting subject to the Act may be conducted by audio or video conference, without the physical presence of a quorum of the members, as long as specified conditions are met. Amends the Chicago School District Article of the School Code. Provides that at a local school council's annual organizational meeting, the local school council shall take a vote to determine if meetings shall be held in-person or remotely; however, provides that a declaration by the Governor or Director of Public Health limiting the size of or prohibiting an in-person meeting shall supersede a local school council's vote to meet in-person. Provides that a local school council has the power and duty to pass resolutions requesting action from a member of the Chicago Board of Education representing the school, and to forward such resolutions to the member. Removes language providing that a school placed on probation that fails to make adequate progress in correcting deficiencies is subject to new local school council elections. Provides that the criteria for determining whether a school should remain on probation or the criteria for determining when a school is in educational crisis shall be delivered to each local school council on or before August 1 (rather than October 31) of each year. Effective immediately."
