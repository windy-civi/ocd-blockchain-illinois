      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Occupational Therapy Practice Act. Requires a licensed occupational therapist or licensed occupational therapy assistant who intends to provide services for individuals, groups, and populations concerning occupational therapy needs without a referral to do so within the licensee's scope of practice. Provides that a referral is not required for the purpose of providing consultations, habilitation services, screenings, education, wellness services, preventions services, environmental assessments, and work-related ergonomic services. Provides that, except for occupational therapy services within the licensee's scope of practice at the time of evaluation and services provided pursuant to provisions concerning when referrals are not required, an occupational therapist shall refer a patient to the patient's treating health care professional of record, or to a health care professional of the patient's choosing if there is no health care professional of record, if the patient meets certain criteria. Provides that an occupational therapist shall refer a patient to the patient's treating health care professional of record, or to a health care professional of the patient's choosing if there is no health care professional of record if the patient does not demonstrate measurable or function improvement after 10 visits (rather than after 10 visits or 15 business days, whichever occurs first)."
