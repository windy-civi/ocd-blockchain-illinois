      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Vehicle Code. Defines \"autonomous vehicle\" as a motor vehicle that possesses the capability (enabled or not) for automated functions to control movement of the vehicle along 2 axes of direction simultaneously. Provides that, before selling or continuing to operate a new or used autonomous vehicle in this State and before updating the software or hardware of any automated driving system on such a vehicle, a manufacturer shall submit to the Department of Transportation documentation regarding the level of driving automation, along with a filing fee in an amount to be determined by the Department. Provides that the Department shall assemble an Automated Driving Systems Review Committee to evaluate submitted documentation and make determinations concerning the level of automated driving capabilities and the suitability of the vehicle for operation on public roads. Provides that an autonomous vehicle classified as having Level 2 Driving Automation may be sold to consumers and registered for use. Provides that the owner of the automated vehicle shall file an annual report with the Department of Transportation stating the number of miles driven per year, the estimated number of miles driven using equipped automated driving systems, and any collisions that occurred involving the vehicle. Prohibits the sale or operation of autonomous vehicles classified as having Level 3, 4, or 5 Driving Automation. Provides that a resident may file a request for the Automated Driving Systems Review Committee to review an existing vehicle sold or registered in this State, and that the Secretary of State shall receive and investigate complaints of a dealer selling a vehicle prohibited for sale under the new provisions. Provides that a person who operates a prohibited vehicle is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and that such a vehicle is subject to impoundment. Provides penalties for the unauthorized sale or modification of an autonomous vehicle."
