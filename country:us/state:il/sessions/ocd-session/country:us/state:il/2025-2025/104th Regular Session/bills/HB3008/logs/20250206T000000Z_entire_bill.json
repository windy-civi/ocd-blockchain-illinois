      "abstract": "Amends the School Code. Authorizes the State Board of Education to administer the Illinois Classroom Supply Assistance Program. Requires the State Board to create a list of preapproved items which may be purchased using funds loaded onto a Classroom Supply Assistance Card (CSAC). Provides that at the beginning of each school quarter starting during the 2027-2028 school year, the State Board shall distribute funds from the Illinois Classroom Supply Assistance Program Fund to teachers throughout the State. Provides that funds for the Program shall be distributed according to a needs-based formula taking into account school district funding, district poverty rates and Title 1 status, per-pupil spending disparities, student performance metrics, and teacher-to-student ratios. Provides that purchases made with a CSAC shall be tracked electronically and monitored to ensure compliance with the list of approved supplies. Provides that teachers shall have access to an online portal to manage funds, review balances, and track purchases. Provides that annual audits shall be conducted to maintain transparency and prevent misuse. Requires the State Board to launch a pilot program in high-needs districts for the 2025-2026 and 2026-2027 school years to test the funding model and distribution process. Requires the State Board to annually report to the Governor and the General Assembly on the status of the Program and any problems that arose with its implementation in the preceding calendar year. Creates the Illinois Classroom Supply Assistance Fund. Makes a conforming change in the State Finance Act."
