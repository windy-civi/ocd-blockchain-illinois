      "abstract": "Amends the Property Tax Code. In provisions concerning tax sales, provides that, for tax certificates sold after January 1, 2026, the accrued interest penalty is 0.75% of the certificate amount per month in counties with more than 3,000,000 inhabitants and 1.25% of the certificate amount per month in counties with 3,000,000 inhabitants or less. Makes conforming changes. Changes a fee to $350 (instead of $35) if a petition for tax deed has been filed and a fee to $40 (instead of $4) if a specified notice has been filed. Provides that, for any tax sale, either the collector shall employ an automated bidding system that is programmed to accept the winning bidder at random (instead of the lowest redemption price bid by an eligible tax purchaser, subject to certain limitations) or all tax sales shall be digitally recorded with video and audio. Provides that each county collector in a county with 100,000 (instead of 275,000) or more inhabitants shall adopt a single bidder rule sufficient to prohibit a tax purchaser from registering more than one related bidding entity at the tax sale."
