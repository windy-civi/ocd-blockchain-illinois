      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Power Agency Act. Removes the requirement for the Illinois Power Agency to annually determine the amount of utility-scale renewable energy credits it will include each year from the self-direct renewable portfolio standard compliance program. Provides that the self-direct credit amount for each renewable energy credit supplied shall be determined annually and is equal to the volumetric charge collected under a provision in the Public Utilities Act. Provides that the approved self-direct credit amount shall be multiplied by each renewable energy credit procured by participating self-direct customers for up to 100% of the self-direct customer's annual consumption. Provides that the self-direct customer's utility bill credit amount shall consist of a credit towards the utility-scale renewable energy portion of the volumetric charge and shall not include a credit toward the portion of the volumetric charge associated with procuring renewable energy credits through existing and future contracts under the Adjustable Block Program, the Solar for All Program, and a specified provision of the Act."
