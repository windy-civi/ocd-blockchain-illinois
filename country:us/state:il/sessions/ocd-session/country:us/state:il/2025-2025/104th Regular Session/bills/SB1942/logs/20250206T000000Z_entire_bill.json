      "abstract": "Creates the Stop Abusive Website Access Litigation Act. Authorizes the Attorney General, on behalf of a class of residents, that is subject to litigation that alleges any website access violation to file a civil action in a State court against the party, attorney, or law firm that initiated the litigation for a determination as to whether this is abusive litigation. Provides that in determining whether the litigation alleging a website access violation constitutes abusive litigation, the trier of fact shall consider the totality of the circumstances to determine if the primary purpose of the litigation that alleges a website access violation is obtaining a payment from a defendant because of the costs of defending the action in court. Creates criteria for the trier of act to determine if the litigation is abusive under the Act. Provides that if the trier of fact determines that the litigation qualifies as abusive litigation under the Act, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the defendant. Provides that the court may also award punitive damages not to exceed 3 times the amount of attorney's fees awarded by the court."
