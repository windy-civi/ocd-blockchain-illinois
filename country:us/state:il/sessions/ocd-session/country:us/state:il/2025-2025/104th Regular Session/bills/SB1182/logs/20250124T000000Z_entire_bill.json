      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Act on the Aging. Provides that by January 1, 2026, the Department on Aging shall seek federal approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for any waiver or State Plan amendment necessary to provide monthly monitoring payments to care coordination units for each active participant enrolled in the Community Care Program who is receiving any allowable service and has not utilized services authorized by the care coordination unit or managed care organization for the month preceding the last month of services. Requires managed care organizations to remediate the full monthly monitoring payment to care coordination units that are providing services in accordance with the Act. Defines \"active participant\" to mean a person 60 years of age or older who has been found eligible to receive Community Care Program services. Provides that to receive administrative payments, a care coordination unit must provide documentation demonstrating that an effort has been made to contact the individual and confirm that the individual no longer needs services provided by the care coordination unit. Requires the Department to secure federal financial participation for expenditures made by the Department for State Fiscal Year 2026 and every State fiscal year thereafter. Effective immediately."
