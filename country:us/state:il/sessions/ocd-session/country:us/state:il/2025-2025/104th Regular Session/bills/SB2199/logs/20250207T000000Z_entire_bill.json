      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Police Training Act. Provides that a law enforcement agency may submit a request for a waiver of training requirements to the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board for a full-time or a part-time law enforcement officer whose certification has become inactive if the officer has at least 2 years of patrol experience after attaining certification (rather than any officer whose certification has become inactive). Provides that within 10 days (rather than 7 days) of receiving a request for a waiver, the Board shall notify the law enforcement officer and the chief administrator of the law enforcement officer's employing agency, whether the request has been granted, denied, or if the Board will take additional time for information."
