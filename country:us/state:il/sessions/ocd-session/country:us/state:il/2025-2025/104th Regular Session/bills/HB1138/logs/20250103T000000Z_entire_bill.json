      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act. Provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and Office of Homeland Security must adopt amendments to its rules governing the administration of the Emergency Management Performance Grant program to ensure that every county emergency services and disaster agency in the State receives a base allotment of no less than $25,000 per fiscal year, with the remaining allocation of funds to be distributed to county emergency services and disaster agencies as deemed appropriate by the Director of the Agency. Provides that, in distributing the remaining allocation of funds, the Director shall consider, among other things, any limitation on a county's tax base, the increased costs of accreditation requirements for smaller agencies, and the increase in the number of disasters that affect smaller counties in the State. Effective immediately."
