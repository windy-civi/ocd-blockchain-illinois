      "abstract": "Amends the Telehealth Act. Adds acupuncturist to providers included in the meaning of \"health care professional\". Amends the Acupuncture Practice Act. Provides that the standard of care for a patient under the Act shall be the same whether a patient is seen in person, through telemedicine, or through another method of electronically-enabled health care. Requires the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, by rule, to determine the appropriate acupuncture services allowed via telemedicine in consultation with the Board of Acupuncture. Provides that a person who engages in the practice of telemedicine without a license issued under the Act shall be subject to the penalties provided in the Act. Provides that, if the Department has reason to believe that a person has violated the provisions regarding telemedicine, the Department may issue a rule to show cause stating the reasons why an order to cease and desist should not be entered against the person. Provides that the rule shall clearly set forth the grounds relied upon by the Department and shall provide the person with a period of 7 days after the date of the rule to file an answer to the satisfaction of the Department. Provides that failure to answer to the satisfaction of the Department shall cause an order to cease and desist to be issued immediately. Provides that a person residing out-of-state that provides services through telemedicine to a patient residing in the State submits himself or herself to the jurisdiction of the Department and the courts of the State."
