      "abstract": "Amends the Public Utilities Act. Provides that termination of water utility service to a residential user, including a tenant of a mastermetered apartment building, for nonpayment of bills is prohibited: (1) on any day when the National Weather Service forecast for the following 6 days covering the area of the utility in which the residence is located includes a forecast that the temperature will be 32 degrees Fahrenheit or below; (2) on any day when the National Weather Service forecast for the following 6 days covering the area of the utility in which the residence is located includes a forecast that the temperature will be 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above; or (3) when the National Weather Service issues an excessive heat watch, excessive heat warning, or heat advisory covering the area of the utility in which the residence is located. In provisions concerning procedures for a large public utility to acquire a water or sewer utility, provides that if the water or sewer utility being acquired is owned by the State or a political subdivision of the State, a referendum will be required to approve the acquisition of the water or sewer utility by the large public utility (rather than only requiring a public meeting and publication of the terms of acquisition in a newspaper of general circulation in the area that the water or sewer utility operates). Effective immediately."
