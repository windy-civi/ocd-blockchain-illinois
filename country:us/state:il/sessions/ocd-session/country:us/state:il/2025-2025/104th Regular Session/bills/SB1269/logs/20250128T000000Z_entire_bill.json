In a provision concerning participation in the Fund by a person who holds an elective office, provides that a person who holds an elective office and has not elected to participate in the Fund with respect to that office shall not be disqualified from receiving service credit for service in that elected office as long as the member participated in a non-elected position with the employer for which the member is now an elected official; the employer has continued to make member contributions for that period of service; and there is no gap in service credit between the 2 positions. Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement."
