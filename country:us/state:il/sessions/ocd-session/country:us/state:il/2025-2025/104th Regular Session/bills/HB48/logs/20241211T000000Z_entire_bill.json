In a provision permitting an interactive video conference in establishing a quorum for a local workforce investment area in an open meeting of that public body, with certain conditions, adds that a tourism board, convention center board, or civic center board also is permitted to use an interactive video conference in establishing a quorum, with the same conditions. In a provision exempting a local workforce innovation area, with certain conditions, from requirements to be physically present at the location of a closed meeting, adds the same exemption for a tourism board, convention center board, or civic center board, with the same conditions. In a provision exempting a local workforce innovation area, with certain conditions, from limitations regarding attendance by members of a public body by a means other than physical presence, adds the same exemption for a tourism board, convention center board, or civic center board, with the same conditions. Replaces references to \"local workforce innovation areas\" with references to \"local workforce investment areas\" in provisions regarding exemptions from requirements to be physically present at the location of a closed meeting and exemptions from limitations regarding attendance by other than physical presence."
