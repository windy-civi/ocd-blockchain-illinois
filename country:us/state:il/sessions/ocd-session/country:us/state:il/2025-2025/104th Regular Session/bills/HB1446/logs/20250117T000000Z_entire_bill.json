      "abstract": "Creates the Temporary Firearm Storage Act. Requires all law enforcement agencies to establish temporary firearm storage programs. Provides that a law enforcement agency may only store a firearm if the owner of the firearm fills out an application stating (i) that the owner of the firearm is requesting the law enforcement agency to hold the firearm on the owner's behalf, (ii) the length of time the firearm will be held by the law enforcement agency, and (iii) that the owner of the firearm agrees that the firearm shall be turned over to the law enforcement agency if the owner of the firearm does not retrieve the firearm by the agreed upon time. Requires law enforcement agencies to send notice to the owner of a firearm before a storage agreement expires. Provides that, if a law enforcement agency has a public-facing website, then it must describe its temporary firearm storage program on the website. Allows an individual or business that has a Federal Firearms License and is certified by the Illinois State Police under the Firearm Dealer License Certification Act to establish a temporary firearm storage program. Provides that a law enforcement agency may not use a firearm stored under a temporary firearm storage program for any purpose without a warrant. Provides that neither a law enforcement agency nor a private entity that establishes a temporary firearm storage program shall be held liable for damage to a firearm stored under a temporary firearm storage program. Provides that a firearm may not be stored in a temporary firearm storage program without a safe storage mechanism. Effective one year after becoming law."
