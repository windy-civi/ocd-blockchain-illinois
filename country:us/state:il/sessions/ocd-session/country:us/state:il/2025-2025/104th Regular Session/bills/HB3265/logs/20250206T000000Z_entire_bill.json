      "abstract": "Creates the Residential Automated Solar Permitting Platform Act. Provides that on or before July 1, 2026, municipalities with a population of more than 5,000 residents and all counties must adopt a residential automated solar permitting platform. Requires the public reporting of information about such a platform on the official website of the municipality and county. Provides that a person or entity aggrieved by a violation of the Act or any rule adopted under the Act may file a civil action in the county in which the alleged offense occurred or where any person who is party to the action resides, without regard to exhaustion of any alternative administrative remedies provided in the Act. Provides that a person or entity whose rights have been violated under the Act by a municipality or county is entitled to collect: (i) up to 50% of the total cost of the residential photovoltaic system installation for which the permit is requested; (ii) in the case of unlawful retaliation, all legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate; and (iii) attorney's fees and costs. Creates a statute of limitations for a civil action 3 years from the date that a person or entity requested a permit for a residential photovoltaic system."
