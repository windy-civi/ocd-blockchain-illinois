Provides that the Department of Healthcare and Family Services may provide medical assistance coverage to persons who are foreign-born victims of human trafficking, torture, or other serious crimes, and their derivative family members, if such persons meet certain residency and income requirements and meet one of the following conditions: (i) have filed an application for asylum status that is pending with the appropriate federal agency or have a pending appeal of such an application; (ii) are receiving services through a federally funded treatment center; (iii) have filed an application for T nonimmigrant status; (iv) have filed an application for U nonimmigrant status; or (v) have filed as a derivative family member of a T or U nonimmigrant status applicant. Removes language conditioning medical assistance eligibility for such persons on their eligibility for benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program."
