      "abstract": "Amends the School Code. In a provision concerning third party non-instructional services, allows a board of education to enter into a one-time contract (rather than a contract), of no longer than 3 months in duration, with a third party for non-instructional services currently performed by an employee or bargaining unit member for the purpose of augmenting the current workforce in an emergency situation that threatens the safety or health of the school district's students or staff, provided that the school board meets all of its obligations under the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Act prior to entering into such a contract (rather than not specifying a time period). Defines \"emergency situation\". Provides that a board of education that attempts to enter into a contract with a third party for non-instructional services, as specified, more than once during a school year is required to receive the mutual agreement of the affected collective bargaining unit or units. Effective immediately."
