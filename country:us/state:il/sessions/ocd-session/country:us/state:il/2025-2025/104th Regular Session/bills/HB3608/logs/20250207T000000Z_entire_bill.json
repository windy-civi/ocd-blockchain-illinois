Prohibits a person, firm, association, partnership, or corporation from operating a commercial driver training school (rather than a driver training school) or engage in the business of providing any Entry-Level Driver Training or Skills, Road, or Pretrip curriculum for commercial driving for no fee or for a fee involving (1) the driving of motor vehicles or (2) the preparation of an applicant for examination given by the Secretary of State for a driver's license or commercial learner's permit, unless a license therefore has been issued by the Secretary. Requires the Secretary to quarterly review the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Training Provider Registry and the listing of State licensed commercial driving schools. Provides that any person that violates any provision of the Act in relation to the requirements stated in the Code of Federal Regulations shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50,000 for the violation and an additional civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each day during which the violation continues. Allows the State's Attorney of the county in which the violation occurred, the Attorney General, or the Secretary to institute a civil action for an injunction to restrain violations of the Act, any rule adopted under the Act, or any permit or term or condition of a permit or to require such other actions as may be necessary to address violations of the Act, any rule adopted under the Act, any permit or term or condition of a permit, or order. Provides that all funds collected shall be deposited into the Motor Carrier Safety Inspection Fund."
