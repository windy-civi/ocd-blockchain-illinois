      "abstract": "Amends the Department of Transportation Law of the Civil Administrative Code of Illinois. Requires the Department of Transportation to create an intercity bus program. Provides that the Department shall plan for and implement intercity bus routes that (i) add missing frequencies to existing passenger rail routes, (ii) begin frequent departures throughout the day in advance of Amtrak service, and (iii) add smaller towns into the network. Requires bus schedules to be coordinated with intercity and commuter trains so that passengers can conveniently connect between buses and trains. Provides that passengers shall be able to purchase a single ticket for journeys combining intercity buses and intercity trains. Provides that bus-only tickets shall be available for purchase from the same ticketing system used by intercity trains. Allows the Department to implement the program by (i) contracting directly with intercity bus carriers through competitive bids, (ii) contracting through Amtrak's Thruway bus program, or (iii) contract directly with a local transit authority within the State."
