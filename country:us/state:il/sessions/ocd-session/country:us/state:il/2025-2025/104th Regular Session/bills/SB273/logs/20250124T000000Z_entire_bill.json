      "abstract": "Amends the Criminal Code of 2012. Provides that a person who commits the offense of financial exploitation of an elderly person or a person with a disability may be tried in any county in which any part of the assets that the person obtained control over are held. Provides that a defense to aggravated battery of a person 60 years of age or older does not exist merely because the accused reasonably believed the victim to be less than 60 years of age. Enhances the penalties for theft and theft by deception if the victim is 60 years of age or older or a person with a disability or if the offense was committed in a nursing home, an assisted living facility, or a supportive living facility. Provides that theft, theft by deception, and financial exploitation of an elderly person or a person with a disability is a Class X felony if the value of the property stolen or illegally obtained exceeds $100,000 (rather than $1,000,000)."
