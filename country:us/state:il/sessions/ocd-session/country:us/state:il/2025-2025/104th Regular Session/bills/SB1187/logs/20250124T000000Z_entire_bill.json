      "abstract": "Amends the Chicago Police Article of the Illinois Pension Code. Provides that for Tier 2 policemen, \"final average salary\" is the greater of: (i) the average monthly salary obtained by dividing the total salary of the policeman during the 96 consecutive months of service within the last 120 months of service in which the total salary was the highest; or (ii) the average monthly salary obtained by dividing the total salary of the policeman during the 48 consecutive months of service within the last 60 months of service in which the total salary was the highest. Provides that the limit on salary for all purposes under the Code for Tier 2 policemen shall annually be increased by the lesser of 3% or the annual (instead of one-half of the annual) unadjusted percentage increase in the consumer price index-u, including all previous adjustments. Provides that the surviving spouse's annuity for certain Tier 2 policemen shall be 54% of the policeman's monthly salary at the time of the policeman's death. Provides that if the deceased policeman was a parent of a child or children and there is a surviving spouse, 12% of the policeman's monthly salary at the date of death, or 12% of the policeman's earned pension, shall be granted to the guardian of any such minor child or children. Provides that upon the death of the surviving spouse leaving one or more children under the age of 18, or upon the death of a policeman leaving one or more children but no surviving spouse, a monthly pension of 20% of the policeman's monthly salary at the date of death or 20% of the policeman's earned pension at the date of death shall be granted to the guardian of each such child until the child reaches age 18. Makes other changes. Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement. Effective immediately."
