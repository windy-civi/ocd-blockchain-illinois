Provides that as soon as practicable, the Department of Children and Family Services, in consultation with the county board of each county, shall identify hospital emergency departments, fire stations, emergency medical facilities, and police stations to install, maintain, and provide outreach regarding newborn safety devices. Provides that each county having a population less than 500,000 shall identify one hospital emergency department, fire station, emergency medical facility, or police station to install a newborn safety device; and each county having a population greater than 500,000 shall identify a total of 4 hospital emergency departments, fire stations, emergency medical facilities, or police stations, or any combination of those facilities, to install a newborn safety device. Requires the Department to award grants to the designated facilities of each county to pay for the installation of a newborn safety device and any other costs associated with maintaining proper operation of the device. Provides that a designated facility's acceptance of the grant award and any agreement to install and maintain a newborn safety device shall be strictly voluntary. Provides that a hospital emergency department, fire station, emergency medical facility, or police station that operates a newborn safety device is immune from civil liability for an act or omission relating to the operation of the newborn safety device unless the act or omission constitutes gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. Makes conforming changes throughout the Act."
