      "abstract": "Amends the Department of Professional Regulation Law of the Civil Administrative Code of Illinois. In provisions concerning applicants with criminal convictions, requires the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation to consider various factors when considering whether a prior conviction is directly related to the ability of an applicant to safely perform the duties, functions, and responsibilities of the position (instead of whether a prior conviction will impair the ability of the applicant to engage in the practice). Sets forth provisions concerning written findings in an adverse decision, appeal rights, notice requirements, and criminal records not subject to disclosure by an applicant. Removes the requirement that a person who is licensed or registered to engage in any of the professions licensed or registered by the Department be of good moral character. Prohibits the Department from using a vague term in its consideration of a criminal record and decision regarding whether a criminal record is disqualifying for licensure, certification, or registration, including, but not limited to, \"good moral character\", \"moral turpitude\", or \"character and fitness\". Makes other changes. Amends the Barber, Cosmetology, Esthetics, Hair Braiding, and Nail Technology Act of 1985. Provides that no application shall be automatically placed on hold, delayed, denied, or otherwise not processed by the Department because it was submitted by a person who is incarcerated. Provides that when determining the qualifications for a license, the Department shall include practice that is supervised by a licensee while a person is incarcerated."
