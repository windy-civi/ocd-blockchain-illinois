Provides that the list shall include a description of each hospital item or service provided by the hospital; specified charges for each individual hospital item or service when provided in either an inpatient setting or an outpatient department setting, as applicable; and a code used by the hospital for the purpose of accounting or billing for the hospital item or service, including the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code, the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) code, the National Drug Code (NDC), or other common identifiers. Requires a hospital to maintain and make publicly available a list of the standard charges for each of at least 300 shoppable services provided by the hospital with charges specific to that individual hospital location, except as specified in the Act.
