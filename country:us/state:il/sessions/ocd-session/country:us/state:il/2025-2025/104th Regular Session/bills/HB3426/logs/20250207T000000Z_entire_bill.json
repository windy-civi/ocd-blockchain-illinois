      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Insurance Code. Increases one of the fees allowed as part of the taxable costs in a specified action to $240,000 (instead of $60,000). Provides that it shall be unlawful for any company transacting insurance business in this State to pay a claim of an insured property owner for loss by fire or explosion to a structure located in this State where the amount recoverable for loss to the structure under a policy exceeds $100,000 (instead of $25,000), until the insurance company receives the required certificate. Sets forth provisions concerning adjustment and settlement of first party property insurance losses based on replacement cost. Requires the insurer to replace items with material of like kind and quality so as to conform to a reasonably uniform appearance, including interior and exterior covered losses, when a covered loss for real property requires the replacement of an item or items and the replacement item or items do not match adjacent items in quality, color, or size. Excludes expenses to be reimbursed to the public adjuster from the 10% cap on a public adjuster's salary, fee, commission, compensation, or consideration. Provides that the policies must be individually underwritten for personal, family, or household use. Provides that expenses to be reimbursed to the public adjuster are not limited to emergency mitigation expenses, and requires expenses to be reimbursed to the public adjuster regardless of whether the expense is covered by the applicable insurance policy. Includes the named insured's public adjuster and the named insured's attorney as designees."
