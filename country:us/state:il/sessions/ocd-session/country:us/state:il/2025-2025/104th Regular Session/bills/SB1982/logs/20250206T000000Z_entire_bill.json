Provides that, after completion of a training program, a public health dental hygienist may provide services according to the terms of a supervision agreement (rather than may operate in a public health setting that meets the requirements in the Act) with a dentist who is working in or has contracted with a local or State government agency or institution or who is providing services as part of a certified school-based program or school-based oral health program. Provides that care provided by a public health dental hygienist under a supervision agreement may take place in any setting outside of a private dental office."
