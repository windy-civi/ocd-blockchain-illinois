      "abstract": "Amends the Department of Transportation Law of the Civil Administrative Code of Illinois. Requires the Department of Transportation to install level II electric vehicle charging stations at each rest stop along each interstate highway in the State. Provides that, subject to approval by the United States Secretary of Transportation, the Department may install direct current fast-charging stations at each rest stop along each interstate highway in the State, which charge an electric vehicle charging fee in an amount no greater than what is necessary to offset the cost to the State in constructing and maintaining the charging infrastructure and procuring electricity. Allows the Department to adopt rules to implement the provisions. Amends the State Finance Act. Creates the EV Charging Station Fund for expenses directly related to the installation, maintenance, procuring electricity, and other costs associated with electric vehicle charging stations at highway rest stops. Amends the Illinois Vehicle Code. Increases the additional fee for registration of an electric vehicle to $150 (currently $100), with $50 being deposited into the EV Charging Station Fund."
