      "abstract": "Creates the Keeping Children Safe Act. Prohibits a court from ordering family reunification treatments, programs, or services that, as a condition of enrollment or participation, require or result in any of the following: (i) a no contact order, (ii) an overnight, out-of-state, or multiday stay, (iii) a transfer of physical or legal custody of the child, (iv) the use of private youth transporters or private transportation agents engaged in the use of force, threat of force, physical obstruction, acutely distressing circumstances, or circumstances that place the safety of the child at risk, or (v) the use of threats of physical force, undue coercion, verbal abuse, isolation from the child's family, community, or other sources of support, or other acutely distressing circumstances. Applies the Act to any proceeding involving the support, custody, visitation, allocation of parental responsibilities, education, parentage, property interest, or general welfare of a child. Provides that the Act does not affect the authority granted to the courts and the Department of Children and Family Services under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987."
