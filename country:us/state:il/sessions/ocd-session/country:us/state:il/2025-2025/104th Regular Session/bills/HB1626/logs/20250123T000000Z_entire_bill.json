Provides that, if an individual is treated at a hospital and the hospital conducts a urine drug screening to assist in diagnosing the individual's condition, the hospital shall include testing for fentanyl in the individual's urine screening. Provides that if the urine drug screening, conducted in accordance with the provisions, detects fentanyl, the hospital shall report the test results, which shall be deidentified, to the Department of Public Health through the State-designated health information exchange. Provides that a hospital that does not have chemical analyzer equipment is not subject to the provisions. Provides that the provisions do not affect any State law which provides civil or criminal immunity to an individual who is in need of medical assistance after ingesting or using alcohol or drugs or to an individual who, in good faith, assists another who is in need of medical assistance after ingesting or using alcohol or drugs. Effective immediately."
