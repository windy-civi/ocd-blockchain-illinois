      "abstract": "Amends the Election Code. Provides that, beginning January 1, 2026, the Board of Elections is responsible for the regulation and oversight of all private, nongovernmental funds from an organization or an individual that are given or distributed to an election authority for the election authority to use. Provides that an election authority may not apply for or request in some other manner any private, nongovernmental funding from any source, but, rather, the Board may seek and apply for private, nongovernmental grants and donations to secure funds that will be distributed to election authorities to assist the election authorities in carrying out duties related to official day-to-day operations and the administration of elections within the election authorities' respective jurisdictions. Provides that the Board shall deposit moneys received into the Election Authority Support Fund and shall publish notices of funds available to election authorities in the State. Provides that funds distributed to election authorities must be directly proportional to the total population residing within the jurisdiction of the selected election authority during the first round of applications, and, if any money is left over after the first round, funds may be distributed in a nonproportional manner to those applicants in the second round. Requires rules to be adopted by the Board, and contains other regulations and restrictions relating to funds granted to or received by the Board. Amends the State Finance Act to establish the Election Authority Support Fund. Effective immediately."
