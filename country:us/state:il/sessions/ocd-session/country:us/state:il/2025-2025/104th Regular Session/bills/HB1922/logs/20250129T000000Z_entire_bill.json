      "abstract": "Amends the Medical Assistance Article of the Illinois Public Aid Code. In a provision concerning payments to nursing facilities to increase compensation for certified nursing assistants (CNA), removes language requiring the Department of Healthcare and Family Services to establish, by rule, payments to nursing facilities equal to Medicaid's share of the tenure wage increments for all reported CNA employee hours compensated. Instead provides that, based on the schedule set forth in the amendatory Act, the Department shall pay to each facility Medicaid's share of the facility's estimated CNA hours performed by employees and agency workers, estimated overtime hours, and benefits and taxes paid to and on behalf of CNA workers at the beginning of each quarter. Provides that moneys paid by the Department to each facility and moneys paid by each facility to workers and agencies or on behalf of workers and agencies shall be reconciled at the end of each quarter. Sets for a schedule concerning the calculation of tenure compensation which shall include: (i) compensation for regular CNA hours; (ii) overtime calculated at time and a half; and (iii) benefits and taxes at 25%. Provides that estimates of overtime shall be calculated at time and a half and benefits and taxes at 25%. Requires the Department to pay the facility for qualifying promotions estimated at the beginning of each quarter and reconciled at the end of the quarter. Effective immediately."
