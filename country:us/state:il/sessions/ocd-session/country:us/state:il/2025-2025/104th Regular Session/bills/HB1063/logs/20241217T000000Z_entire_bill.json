      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Works Jobs Program Act. Provides that, for the purpose of the Illinois Works Apprenticeship Initiative, apprenticeship programs must provide to the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity evidence that the apprenticeship program has graduated, in each of the 3 calendar years immediately preceding the date on which the public works project begins, at least 2 apprentices in each construction craft to be performed at the relevant project. Provides that apprenticeship programs are not required to provide graduation information with respect to apprenticeship crafts that are dedicated exclusively to the transportation of materials and equipment to and from the project. Provides that those provisions do not apply to public works projects contracted by school districts or units of local government. Effective immediately."
