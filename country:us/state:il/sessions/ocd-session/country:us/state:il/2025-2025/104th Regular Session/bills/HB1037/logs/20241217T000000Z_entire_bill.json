      "abstract": "Amends the Criminal Code of 2012. Increases penalties for unlawful possession of weapons by felons or persons in the custody of the Department of Corrections facilities. Provides that a person commits unlawful sale or delivery of firearms when he or she knowingly: (1) sells or gives a firearm to a person who has been convicted of a felony or who is a streetgang member or (2) sells or gives a firearm that has been purchased or acquired out of state to a person who has been convicted of a felony or is a streetgang member. Provides that a violation is a Class 1 felony. Provides that a second or subsequent violation is non-probationable. Amends the Unified Code of Corrections. Deletes a provision that the first offense had to be committed when the person was 21 years of age or older to be adjudged a habitual criminal. Provides that a person who attained the age of 18 at the time of the third offense may be adjudged a habitual criminal. In the Class X sentencing provision for a defendant over 21 years of age who is convicted of a Class 1 or Class 2 felony after twice being convicted of a Class 1 or Class 2 felony, deletes a provision that the first offense had to be committed when the person was 21 years of age or older and deletes a provision that the offenses had to be forcible felonies. Exempts theft from this calculation."
