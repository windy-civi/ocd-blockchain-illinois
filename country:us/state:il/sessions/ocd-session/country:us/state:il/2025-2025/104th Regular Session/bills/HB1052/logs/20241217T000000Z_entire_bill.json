      "abstract": "Creates the Food Truck Freedom Act. Provides that a municipality, county, or township may create a license or permitting scheme for a food truck to operate within its jurisdiction. Provides that a food truck license or permit obtained from a municipality, county, or township in Illinois has full force and effect in all other jurisdictions in Illinois so long as that license or permit was issued after: (1) an inspection by a local health department that uses recommendations made by the Food and Drug Administration concerning food trucks and (2) an inspection by a local fire department that uses recommendations made by the National Fire Prevention Association concerning food trucks. Provides that nothing in the provisions prevents a municipality, county, or township from imposing placement or zoning restrictions or fees so long as those restrictions and fees are uniformly applied to all food trucks, regardless of the food truck's license or permit jurisdiction. Defines \"food truck\". Limits the concurrent exercise of home rule powers. Effective January 1, 2026."
