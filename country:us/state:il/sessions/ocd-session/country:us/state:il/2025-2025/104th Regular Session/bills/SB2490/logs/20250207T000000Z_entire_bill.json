      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Gambling Act. Provides that, if the Illinois Gaming Board is otherwise authorized to issue licenses to conduct Internet gaming, the Board shall not issue a license if the applicant or any of its affiliates is knowingly accepting, directly or indirectly, revenue that is derived from (i) any jurisdiction on the Black List of Money Laundering Countries, as established by the Financial Action Task Force, or (ii) any jurisdiction designated by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism. Provides that, if at any time during licensure, the Board determines that the licensee or any of its affiliates is knowingly accepting, directly or indirectly, revenue that is derived from any jurisdiction on the Black List of Money Laundering Countries, as established by the Financial Action Task Force, or any jurisdiction designated by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism, then the Board shall impose a penalty of license revocation if it determines, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that it would further the public interest to discontinue such operations of the interactive gaming licensee. Effective immediately."
