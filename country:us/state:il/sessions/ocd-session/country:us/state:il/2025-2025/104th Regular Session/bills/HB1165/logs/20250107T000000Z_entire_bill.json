      "abstract": "Amends the Children With Disabilities Article of the School Code. Allows a school district to place a student in a nonpublic day facility or residential special education facility providing educational services but not approved by the State Board of Education (rather than a nonpublic residential special education facility providing educational services but not approved by the State Board of Education) if the State Board of Education provides an emergency and student-specific approval for residential or day placement. Makes changes to provisions concerning the circumstances under which the State Board of Education will grant such an approval. Grants jurisdiction to the State Board's impartial due process hearing officer to resolve disputes involving the need for placement in a non-approved, student-specific, emergency placement, the selection of the facility, and whether an approved facility is an appropriate alternative to a non-approved facility. Makes conforming and other changes."
