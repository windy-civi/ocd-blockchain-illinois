Amends the Landlord and Tenant Act to provide that no person has a right to occupy or remain on or in any real property, residence, or structure in which the person has no written property interest under a written lease or rental agreement with the owner of the property. Provides that all persons legally occupying the property, residence, or structure shall be listed by name and date of birth on leases, rental agreements, or the rental application associated with the lease or rental agreement. Provides that no subleasing is allowed unless it is specifically allowed in the tenant's written lease or rental agreement with the owner. Provides that any such violation of the lease or rental agreement does not establish legal standing to occupy or remain on or in any real property, residence, or structure by the sublessee who must vacate the property after receiving notice to vacate from the property owner of record or the owner's agent."
