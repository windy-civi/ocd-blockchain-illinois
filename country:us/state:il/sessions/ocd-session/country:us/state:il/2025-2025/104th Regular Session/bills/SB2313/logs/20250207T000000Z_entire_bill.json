      "abstract": "Amends the Electric Vehicle Rebate Act. Authorizes rebates for electric vehicles that are electric motorcycles. Specifies that, for a purchaser to be eligible to receive a rebate under the Act, the purchaser must, among other things, apply for the rebate within 180 days (rather than 90 days) after purchase, during an open rebate cycle as identified by the Agency, and certify that the purchaser qualifies as low-income. Provides that amounts appropriated to and deposited into the Electric Vehicle Rebate Fund from the General Revenue Fund, or any other fund, (rather than only the General Revenue Fund) shall be distributed from the Electric Vehicle Rebate Fund to fund the electric vehicle rebate program established under the Act. Makes changes to definitions. Effective July 1, 2025."
