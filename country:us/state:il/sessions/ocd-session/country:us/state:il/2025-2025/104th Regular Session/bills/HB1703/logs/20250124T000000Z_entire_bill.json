Provides that an Executive Inspector General may issue a public statement when the Executive Inspector General concludes its investigation and (i) recommends systemic or procedural action based on the investigation or (ii) finds reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred and the Executive Inspector General believes that a complaint concerning the investigation should not be filed by the Attorney General with the Executive Ethics Commission. Limits the scope of a public statement that may be issued. Provides that, before issuing a public statement, the Executive Inspector General shall share the public statement with the agency head and ultimate jurisdictional authority affected by the investigation and allow the agency head and ultimate jurisdictional authority affected by the investigation a period of 10 business days to provide the Executive Inspector General with a response to the proposed public statement, which must be included with the public statement. Effective immediately."
