Provides that every manufacturer of an electronic or appliance product with a specified wholesale price or direct sales price shall make service and repair facilities available to owners of the product. Provides that the manufacturer shall make available to service and repair facilities and service dealers sufficient documentation and functional parts and tools, inclusive of any updates, on fair and reasonable terms, to effect the diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of a product for a specified period after the last date a product model or type was manufactured, regardless of whether the period exceeds the warranty period for the product. Provides that a service and repair facility or service dealer that is not an authorized repair provider of a manufacturer shall provide a written notice to any customer seeking repair of an electronic or appliance product before the repair facility or service dealer repairs the product that informs the customer that it is not an authorized repair provider for the product and shall disclose if it uses any used replacement parts or replacement parts provided by a supplier other than the manufacturer of the product. Provides that no manufacturer or authorized repair provider shall be liable for any damage or injury caused to any electronic or appliance product, person, or property that occurs as a result of repair, diagnosis, maintenance, or modification performed by a service dealer or owner.
