      "abstract": "Amends the General Provisions Article of the Illinois Pension Code. Defines \"eligible Tier 2 member\" as a member who first became a member under a retirement system or pension fund established under the Code on or after January 1, 2011 and whose service under the applicable Article is not eligible for Social Security coverage. Defines \"hypothetical Social Security benefit\" as the value of the Social Security benefit an eligible Tier 2 member would receive if the eligible Tier 2 member's service had been eligible for Social Security coverage. Provides that if an eligible Tier 2 member would receive a pension benefit that is less than the eligible Tier 2 member's hypothetical Social Security benefit, then the eligible Tier 2 member's pension benefit shall be increased to the amount of the hypothetical Social Security benefit plus $1. Provides that the determination shall be made on an annual basis, and the amount of the pension benefit shall be adjusted annually. In the State Employees, State Universities, and Downstate Teachers Articles, provides that any benefit increase that results from the amendatory Act is excluded from the definition of \"new benefit increase\". Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement by the State."
