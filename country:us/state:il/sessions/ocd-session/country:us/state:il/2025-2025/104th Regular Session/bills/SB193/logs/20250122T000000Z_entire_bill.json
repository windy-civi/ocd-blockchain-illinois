      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Municipal Code. Provides that a municipality may establish an apprenticeship program through which the municipality's full-time fire department may contract with a fire protection district to have the municipality's apprentices age 18 to 20 perform volunteer apprentice firefighter duties for the fire protection district's volunteer fire department. Requires the contract between the fire department and fire protection district to specify the duties a volunteer apprentice firefighter may perform for the fire protection district, specify the training the volunteer apprentice firefighter must have before working for the fire protection district, and describe whether the volunteer apprentice firefighter will be performing firefighting duties requiring the apprentice to first obtain Basic Operations Firefighter Certification from the Office of the State Fire Marshal. Requires a program established under the provisions to be a mandatory subject of bargaining. Provides that to be admitted to the apprenticeship program an individual must commit to working as a volunteer apprentice firefighter for the fire protection district until age 21 and to working 3 years as a full-time firefighter with the municipality's fire department. Amends the Fire Protection District Act. Provides that no person who is under 21 years of age shall be eligible for employment as a firefighter unless hired as a volunteer apprentice firefighter through an apprenticeship program."
