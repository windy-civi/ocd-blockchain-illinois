      "abstract": "Creates the Emergency Co-Response Grant Act. Provides that the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority shall, subject to appropriation, make grants to law enforcement departments to establish or maintain a co-response unit. Defines terms, including \"co-response unit\" to mean a unit of a law enforcement department featuring a specially trained team focused on de-escalation that includes at least one law enforcement officer and at least one clinician or trained civilian directly dispatched to emergency calls in which a behavioral health crisis is likely to be involved. Establishes requirements for applications for grants and use of grant moneys from the Emergency Co-Response Grant Fund. Requires each law enforcement department receiving a grant under the Act to submit a report to the General Assembly, the Governor, and the Agency, which shall also be posted on each law enforcement department's website, after July 1, 2031 but before January 1, 2032 on the programmatic and fiscal savings associated with co-response units, key conclusions, populations served, the benefits conferred or realized, and resulting policy recommendations to provide guidance to the General Assembly, the Governor, and the Agency in fully implementing and scaling permanent units. Requires joint adoption of rules to implement the Act, including requirements for law enforcement department co-response units receiving grants under the Act. Repeals the Act on January 1, 2033. Amends the State Finance Act creating the Emergency Co-Response Grant Fund. Effective immediately."
