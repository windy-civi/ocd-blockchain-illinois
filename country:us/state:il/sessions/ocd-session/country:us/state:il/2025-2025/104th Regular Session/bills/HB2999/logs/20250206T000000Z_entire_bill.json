Prohibits restrictions based upon the age of a manufactured home. Provides that a person who is the owner of real property or who has a right to the use of real property may install and occupy a pre-owned manufactured home on the property if the pre-owned manufactured home complies with specified provisions and is on property that is zoned for residential use.
