      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Horse Racing Act of 1975. Provides that the Illinois Racing Board may appoint the Director of Mutuels to serve as the State director for inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering by inter-track wagering licensees and inter-track wagering location licensees. Provides that the pari-mutuel tax imposed at all pari-mutuel wagering facilities and on advance deposit wagering shall be remitted to the Board (rather than the Department of Revenue). Provides that the Board shall distribute contributed funds to a charitable organization on a schedule determined by the Board, based on the charitable organization's estimated expenditures related to the grant (rather than by December 31 of each year). Provides that any funds not expended by the grantee in a grant year shall be distributed to the charitable organization or charitable organizations selected in the next grant year after the funds are recovered. Repeals provisions authorizing the Board to make daily temporary deposits of certain fees and provisions requiring the Board and the Department of Agriculture to establish a program to conduct drug testing on horses at county fairs. Makes other changes. Effective immediately."
