      "abstract": "Amends the Charter Schools Article of the School Code. Provides that that for charter schools authorized by a local school district, administrative fees withheld from a charter school for the purpose of conducting administrative duties related to the administration of charter school contracts, oversight, and authorizing services shall be capped at 3% or less of the total annual public dollars allocated to the charter school. Provides that the 3% total administrative fee collected from a charter school shall include a 2% or less administrative fee collected by a local school district for the purpose of conducting administrative duties related to the administration of charter school contracts, oversight, and authorizing services and 1% to a statewide charter school membership association for the purpose of administering state mandated board governance training. Allows the State Board of Education to withhold up to a 3% administrative fee as the sole statewide charter school authorizer for the purpose of conducting administrative duties related to the administration of charter school contracts, oversight, and authorizing services. Requires that principal metric a district shall consider for a charter school renewal to be academic achievement. Provides that a local school district authorizer shall grant renewal terms of no fewer than 5 years upon renewal of a charter agreement if the charter's average annual summative designation over the term of the contract is in the top 3 summative designations on the State Report Card."
