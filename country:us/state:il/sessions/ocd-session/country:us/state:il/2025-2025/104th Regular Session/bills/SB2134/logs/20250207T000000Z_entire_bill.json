Retains provisions that crime victims shall be given notice by the State's Attorney's office of the preliminary hearing as required in the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act and shall be informed of their opportunity at this hearing to obtain an order of protection under the Protective Orders Article of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Amends the Statute on Statutes to provide that whenever there is a reference in any Act to the term \"pretrial release\", \"denial of pretrial release\", \"conditions of pretrial release\", or \"violations of the conditions of pretrial release\", the terms shall be construed to mean \"bail\", \"denial of bail\", \"conditions of bail\", or \"forfeiture of bail\" respectively. Effective immediately."
