      "abstract": "Creates the Access to Prescription Drugs Act. Provides that any State agency may enter into partnerships to increase competition, lower prices, and address shortages in the market for generic prescription drugs; to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for public and private purchasers, taxpayers, and consumers; and to increase patient access to affordable drugs. Requires the partnerships to result in the production or distribution of generic prescription drugs with the intent that these drugs be made widely available to public and private purchasers, providers and suppliers, and pharmacies. Provides that the State agency shall comply with specified requirements when entering into partnerships or setting prices for generic prescription drugs. Requires a State agency that elects to enter into a partnership under the Act to submit separate reports to the General Assembly that (1) assess the feasibility of directly manufacturing generic prescription drugs and selling generic prescription drugs at a fair price; and (2) describe the status of all drugs targeted under the Act and analyze how the activities of the State agency may impact competition, access to targeted drugs, the costs of those drugs, and the costs of generic prescription drugs to public and private purchasers. Contains other provisions. Amends the Freedom of Information Act to exempt certain information disclosed under Access to Prescription Drugs Act from inspection and copying under the Act. Contains a severability provision. Effective July 1, 2025."
