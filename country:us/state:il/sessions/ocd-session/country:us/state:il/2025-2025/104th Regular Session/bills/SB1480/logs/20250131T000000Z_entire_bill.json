      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Insurance Code. Provides that all group and individual health insurance policies issued, delivered, amended, or renewed in Illinois that provide coverage for medical or surgical conditions shall also provide coverage for crisis services, regardless of any difference in billing codes used for such services. Provides that coverage for crisis services may not be denied or restricted based on the modality or setting of the services; and that crisis services shall be covered whether delivered in person, through telehealth, or in a residential or outpatient setting, to the extent that such services are covered in other settings or modalities under the policy. Makes conforming changes to the State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971, the Illinois Municipal Code, the School Code, the Health Maintenance Organization Act, the Telehealth Act, and the Illinois Public Aid Code. Amends the Strengthening and Transforming Behavioral Health Crisis Care in Illinois Act. Renames the Act the Crisis Continuum Sustainability Act. Provides that on or before December 31, 2028, and every 5 years thereafter, the Department of Human Services shall, subject to available funding and in collaboration with relevant stakeholders and State bodies, develop and submit a Statewide Crisis Continuum Strategic Plan to the Office of the Governor and the General Assembly, with the goal of ensuring every Illinoisan has timely access to appropriate and supportive behavioral health response during a behavioral health crisis. Requires the strategic plan to identify statewide goals, key stakeholders, and performance metrics for expanding access to behavioral health crisis continuum services across Illinois; address gaps in service delivery; and other matters."
