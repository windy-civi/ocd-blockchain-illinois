      "abstract": "Amends the Clinical Psychologist Licensing Act. In provisions concerning written collaborative agreements, removes a provision prohibiting a prescribing psychologist from prescribing medications to patients who are less than 17 years of age or over 65 years of age. Provides that no prescriptive authority for any Schedule II opioid shall be delegated. Provides that after the collaborating physician files a notice delegating authority to prescribe any nonnarcotic, nonopioid Schedule II through V controlled substances (rather than any nonnarcotic Schedule III through V controlled substances), the licensed clinical psychologist shall be eligible to register for a mid-level practitioner controlled substance license under the Illinois Controlled Substances Act. Defines \"opioid\". Makes corresponding changes in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act. Amends the Medical Assistance Article of the Illinois Public Aid Code. Provides that the Department of Healthcare and Family Services shall provide coverage and reimbursement for prescription management services provided by prescribing psychologists for persons who are otherwise eligible for medical assistance under the Article. Effective immediately."
