      "abstract": "Amends the Environmental Protection Act. Provides that the owner or operator of any large GHG-emitting unit in the State, including the owner or operator of an EGU in the State, may petition the Commission for a waiver of any one or more specified emission limitations. Provides that, if the Commission determines, following a hearing, that compliance with any one or more of the emission limitations will either threaten the reliability or adequacy of electricity supplies in the State or will create a significant economic hardship for electricity users in the State, the Commission may enter a written order waiving the operation of those limitations for a period to be specified by the Commission. Provides that, if at any time the Illinois Commerce Commission believes that an impending plant closure would threaten the reliability or adequacy of electricity supplies in the State or create a significant economic hardship for electricity users, the Illinois Commerce Commission shall enter a written order waiving the operation of those limitations for any large GHG-emitting units in the State for a period to be specified by the Commission. Provides that, if there is a conflict between the terms of the Act and an order entered by the Commission, the Commission's order shall control. Effective immediately."
