      "abstract": "Amends the Park District Code. Provides that, if a district board's membership has been expanded or reduced by referendum or resolution, the additional members will be elected not earlier than 225 days (rather than 197 days) after the referendum or resolution, and a reduction of board members will not affect the terms of any commissioners holding office at the time of the referendum or any commissioners to be elected within 225 (rather than 197) days after the referendum. Provides that, if the terms of a district's board members have increased or decreased after referendum or resolution, the terms will commence with the first regular park district election at least 225 days (rather than 197 days) after the date on which the terms were increased or reduced by referendum or resolution. Provides that, if a vacancy in the governing board of a park district occurs with more than 28 months left in the term, but less than 151 days (rather than 123 days) before the next regularly scheduled election for this office, the person appointed to fill the vacancy shall hold his or her office until the second regularly scheduled election for the office following the appointment, at which a member shall be elected to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term. Effective immediately."
