      "abstract": "Creates the Construction Zone Safe Detour Act. Establishes that a company that provides GPS travel services in the State is required to ensure that at least one person is available to receive official requests 24 hours per day, 7 days per week from emergency services, Illinois State Police, or the Department of Transportation for the purpose of implementing proper detours in the event of construction or emergency. Requires a GPS service provider to upload the detour and routing information provided by emergency services, Illinois State Police, or the Department of Transportation into its navigation system to properly route users of the GPS service provider's systems. Provides that a GPS service provider that fails to implement proper detour routing on an ongoing and emergency basis may be liable for treble damages. Allows an affirmative defense for GPS service providers if emergency services, including the Department of Transportation and Illinois State Police, fail to notify the GPS service provider with routing information. Prohibits the Department from conducting construction on a secondary route or parallel primary highway at the same time, except in an emergency. Requires the Department to reimburse local governments for damages caused to roads within the local government's jurisdiction that arise from any detour around or near a construction zone authorized by the Department. Provides that the Department shall adopt emergency rules for the administration of the Act. Defines terms."
