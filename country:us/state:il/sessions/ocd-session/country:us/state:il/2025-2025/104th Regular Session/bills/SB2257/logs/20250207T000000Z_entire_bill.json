Provides that committed persons who wish to receive sentence credit for educational, vocational, substance abuse, behavior modification programs, life skills courses, re-entry planning, and correctional industry programs accumulated prior to the effective date of the amendatory Act in an amount specified in the provision to a committed person serving a sentence for an offense committed after June 19, 1998, if the Department determines that the committed person is entitled to this sentence credit, based upon: (1) documentation provided by the Department that the committed person engaged in any full-time substance abuse programs, correctional industry assignments, educational programs, behavior modification programs, life skills courses, or re-entry planning provided by the Department and satisfactorily completed the assigned program as determined by the standards of the Department during the committed person's current term of incarceration; or (2) the committed person's own testimony in the form of an affidavit or documentation, or a third party's documentation or testimony in the form of an affidavit that the committed person likely engaged in any full-time substance abuse programs, correctional industry assignments, educational programs, behavior modification programs, life skills courses, or re-entry planning provided by the Department and satisfactorily completed the assigned program as determined by the standards of the Department during the committed person's current term of incarceration.
