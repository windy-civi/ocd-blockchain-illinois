Restricts a tow truck operator from allowing passengers to occupy the trailer, semitrailer, farm wagon, or any other vehicle being carried by a flatbed tow truck upon a public highway, unless: (i) the number of people that need to be transported exceeds the seating capacity of the tow truck or a person needing to be transported has a disability that limits that person's ability to enter the tow truck;(ii) there is a way for the passenger in the carried vehicle to immediately communicate, either verbally, audibly, or visually, with the tow truck operator in case of an emergency; and (iii) if the passenger is under 16 years of age, the passenger is accompanied by an adult riding in the same vehicle. Requires that no passenger of a carried vehicle may exit the carried vehicle, ride outside of the passenger compartment of the carried vehicle, or exhibit dangerous or distracting behaviors while the carried vehicle is upon a public highway."
