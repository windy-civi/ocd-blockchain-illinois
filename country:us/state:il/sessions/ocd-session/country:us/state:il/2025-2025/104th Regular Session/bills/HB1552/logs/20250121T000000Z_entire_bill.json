      "abstract": "Creates the School District Impact Note Act. Requires every bill that could have a negative impact on the finances of a school district in the State or that could cause a school district to expend additional staffing resources to have prepared for it by the Illinois State Board of Education a brief explanatory statement or note describing the bill's anticipated impact on education in the State. Specifies the contents of the note and the circumstances under which the note is to be prepared. Clarifies that the preparation of such a note does not preclude a State official or employee from participating in legislative hearings concerning the bill. Provides that the subject matter of bills submitted to the Illinois State Board of Education shall be kept in strict confidence, and no information relating to the bill or its anticipated impact on education in the State shall be divulged, before the bill's introduction in the General Assembly, by any State official or employee of the State Board, except to the bill's sponsor or his or her designee. Effective immediately."
