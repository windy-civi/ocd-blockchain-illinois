Provides that if an indigent defendant is charged with an offense for which a sentence of death is authorized, and the State's Attorney has not, at or before arraignment, filed a certificate indicating he or she will not seek the death penalty or stated on the record in open court that the death penalty will not be sought, the trial court shall immediately appoint the Public Defender, or any other qualified attorney or attorneys as the Illinois Supreme Court shall by rule provide, to represent the defendant as trial counsel. Creates the Capital Litigation Trust Fund. Provides that moneys deposited into the Trust Fund shall be used exclusively for the purposes of providing funding for the prosecution and defense of capital cases and for providing funding for post-conviction proceedings. Amends the State Finance Act. Repeals the Death Penalty Abolition Fund and reinstates the Capital Litigation Trust Fund. Amends the Unified Code of Corrections.
