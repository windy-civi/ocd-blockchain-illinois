      "abstract": "Creates the Tribal Law Enforcement Borders Act. Provides that law enforcement officers of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation may exercise the powers and authority of law enforcement officers anywhere on property owned, occupied, or operated by the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation or at the site of a function sponsored by the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation and other specified areas. Provides that law enforcement officers employed by a Native American Indian Tribe may exercise the powers and authority of law enforcement officers anywhere within the exterior limits of the reservation of the tribe employing the tribal law enforcement officer if the Native American Indian Tribe maintains in force a valid and binding agreement with an insurance carrier to provide liability insurance coverage for damages arising from the acts, errors, or omissions of the tribal law enforcement agency or officer and other specified omissions. Provides that the tribe shall waive its sovereign immunity solely to the extent necessary to permit recovery under the liability insurance, but not to exceed the policy limits. Sets forth provisions concerning county law enforcement borders, municipal law enforcement border, and the powers of all law enforcement officers. Makes other changes."
