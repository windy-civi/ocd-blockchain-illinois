      "abstract": "Amends Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act. Defines \"transfer articulation agreement\". Sets forth the purpose of the Act. Provides that a State university shall (rather than the General Assembly encourages State universities) to facilitate the seamless transfer of credits toward a baccalaureate degree. Provides that a State university shall enter into a transfer articulation agreement with the community college district to provide a seamless pathway for transfer. Provides that if, within 180 calendar days of the community college's initial request to enter into a transfer articulation agreement with the State university, the community college and State university do not reach agreement on the transfer articulation agreement, then the community college and State university shall jointly implement the provisions of the Model Transfer Articulation Agreement. Provides that a Model Transfer Articulation Agreement shall be developed through a Transfer Articulation Committee by December 31, 2025. Requires each community college and State university to publish the institution's process and timeline for reviewing and making decisions regarding transfer credit requests on the institution's website. Removes language regarding the Board of Higher Education's reviews and reports. Provides instead that, by May 1, 2026, and May 1 of each subsequent year, each State university shall report to the Board of Higher Education specified information. Effective immediately."
