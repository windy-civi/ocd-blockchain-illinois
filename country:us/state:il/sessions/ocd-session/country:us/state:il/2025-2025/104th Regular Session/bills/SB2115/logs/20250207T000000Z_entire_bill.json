Provides that \"applicable taxpayer\" means a taxpayer that is not any of the following: (i) a mortgage note holder that owns a single-family residence through foreclosure; (ii) an organization that is described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and exempt from tax under Section 501(a); (iii) an organization primarily engaged in the construction or rehabilitation of single-family residences; or (v) a person who owns federally subsidized housing. Defines \"single-family residence\" as residential property consisting of not more than 4 dwelling units. Provides that this tax must be deposited into the Illinois Affordable Housing Trust Fund to fund housing programs for justice involved individuals and provide rental and mortgage assistance. Requires an applicable taxpayer to report to the Department of Revenue information about applicable single-family residences. Imposes a penalty of $50,000 for failure to comply with these notice provisions. Provides that the applicable taxpayer must give notice to each tenant of a single-family residence of the taxpayer's intent to sell this residence.
