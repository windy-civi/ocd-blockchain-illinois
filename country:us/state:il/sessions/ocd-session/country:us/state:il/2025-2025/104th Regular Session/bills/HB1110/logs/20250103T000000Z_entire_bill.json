      "abstract": "Creates the Gun-Free Zone Liability Act. Provides that the State is liable for harm or damage suffered by a concealed carry licensee or any individual otherwise legally entitled to carry a firearm if the harm or damage occurs in a gun-free zone, as defined by State law, and the harm or damage could have been reasonably avoided if the individual had been allowed to carry his or her concealed firearm in that gun-free zone. Provides that liability includes, but is not limited to, medical expenses, compensation for pain and suffering, loss of income, property damage, and wrongful death claims brought by the victim's estate. Provides that the plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the harm or damage suffered could have been reasonably avoided or mitigated if the plaintiff had been permitted to carry a concealed firearm, and that the plaintiff is otherwise in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding firearm possession and use. Provides exceptions. Provides that any individual who is harmed, if the harm or damage occurred in a gun-free zone, may bring a civil action against the State of Illinois in the circuit court of the county of the plaintiff's residence. Provides that if the plaintiff prevails, he or she is entitled to full compensatory damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney's fees, and any other relief the court deems just and equitable. Contains a severability provision. Defines terms. Effective immediately."
