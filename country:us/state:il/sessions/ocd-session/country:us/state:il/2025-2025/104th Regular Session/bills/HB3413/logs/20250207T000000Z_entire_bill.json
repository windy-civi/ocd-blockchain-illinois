Provides that when a minor of the age of at least 13 years is adjudged delinquent for an offense involving the illegal use or possession of a firearm in which the firearm was discharged in the commission of the offense, the court shall declare the minor a ward of the court and order the minor committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice until the minor's 21st birthday, without the possibility of aftercare release, furlough, or non-emergency authorized absence for a period of 5 years from the date the minor was committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice, except that the time that a minor spent in custody for the instant offense before being committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice shall be considered as time credited towards that 5-year period. Provides that upon release from a Department facility, a minor adjudged delinquent for an offense involving the illegal use or possession of a firearm in which the firearm was discharged in the commission of the offense shall be placed on aftercare release until the age of 21, unless sooner discharged from aftercare release or custodianship is otherwise terminated in accordance with the Act or as otherwise provided for by law."
