Provides that notification of the alleged misconduct and available resources shall also be provided to the employee, agent of the school, or contractor of the school who is alleged to have engaged in sexual misconduct. Requires the governing body of each school district, charter school, or nonpublic school to implement an investigation procedure under which an employee, agent of the school, or contractor of the school is alleged to have engaged in sexual misconduct. Provides that any adverse determination issued to an employee, agent of the school, or contractor of the school for events that occurred prior to the effective date of the amendatory Act shall be considered null and void only if any and all investigations conducted by a regulatory third party entity resulted in a finding that the allegation was false, unfounded, indeterminable, or unsubstantiated or a previous finding was otherwise overturned or expunged on appeal. Requires the adverse determination and related documents to be removed from the applicable personnel records within 14 business days after written notice. Makes other changes."
