      "abstract": "Creates the Rental Fee Transparency and Fairness Act. Provides that unless otherwise allowed under the Act, a landlord's agent may not impose any fee on, or collect any fee from, a tenant related to the rental of residential real property, and any real estate salesperson or real estate broker who publishes a listing for a rental of residential real property with the permission or authorization of the landlord for the property may not impose any fee on, or collect any fee from, a tenant related to the rental of the listed property. Prohibits a person conditioning the rental of residential property on a tenant engaging any agent. Provides that all fees to be paid by a tenant be explicitly contained in the first page of a lease agreement and the itemized disclosure of the fees must include a short description of them. Provides that a tenant is not liable for any fees not so disclosed. Prohibits a lease from containing a clause that: (i) assigns a late fee (not to exceed $25) for the late payment of rent if payment occurs within 7 days of the required date of payment although a lease may provide for a grace period longer than 7 days; (ii) assigns to a tenant an administrative fee for the renewal of a lease agreement; (iii) assigns to a tenant a fee for the modification of a lease; (iv) assigns to a tenant a fee for contacting the building owner or the property manager; (v) assigns to a tenant a fee or penalty for an eviction notice or an eviction action; and (vi) assigns a fee to a tenant for pet occupancy for the duration of the lease. Makes other changes. Provides that the changes to residential lease applies to all lease agreements entered into after the effective date of the Act. Preempts home rule."
