Amends the Landlord and Tenant Act. Provides that no person has the right or legal standing to occupy or remain on or in any real property, residence, or structure if the person has no written property interest under a written lease or rental agreement with the owner of the property listed in county tax records or the owner's agent; no documentation of payment of rent made to the owner of the property or the owner's agent; or otherwise fails to provide any evidence of an oral or written agreement in which a property interest is claimed. Provides that all persons legally occupying a property, residence, or structure shall be listed by name and date of birth on a lease, rental agreement, or rental application associated with the lease or rental agreement or provide evidence that the person is an invitee of a lessee or authorized occupant of the property. Provides that no subleasing shall be allowed or deemed as legal in contrast to a lease or rental agreement that specifically prohibits subleases. Provides that a sublease made in violation of a lease or rental agreement shall not establish legal standing to occupy or remain on or in any real property, residence, or structure by the sublessee and the sublessee shall vacate the property after receiving notice from the property owner of record to depart."
