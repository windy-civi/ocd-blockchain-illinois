      "abstract": "Creates the Curriculum Transparency Act. Requires each school that is operated by a school district or as a public charter school to disclose, not more than 10 days after the first use, on a publicly accessible portion of the school website or the school district website: (1) the procedures or processes in effect for the school principal or other staff to document, review, or approve lesson plans or the learning materials and activities used for student instruction at the school; (2) a listing of the teacher and staff training materials and activities used at the school in the current school year; and (3) a listing of the learning materials and activities used for student instruction at the school in the current school year. Provides that neither the State Board of Education nor the governing board of a public school or public charter school, nor any staff employed thereby and acting in the course of his or her official duties, shall purchase or contract for copyrighted learning materials to be used for student instruction at a school, unless provision is made to allow parents and guardians of enrolled students to review the materials within 10 school days of the submission of a written request to the school. Sets forth ways a party may enforce the Act. Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement."
