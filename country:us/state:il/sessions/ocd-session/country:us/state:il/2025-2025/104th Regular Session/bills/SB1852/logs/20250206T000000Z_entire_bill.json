Provides that the evidence must include evidence of contraband being sent through the mail, data on the number of mail items containing contraband, test results of mail tested due to suspicion of mail containing drugs, data on where inside a correctional institution or facility contraband has been found, and the method of entry of contraband into the correctional institution or facility. Provides that the data and evidence must be made publicly available monthly on the Department's website but no later than 60 days after the use of the exception to the requirements. Provides that no committed person shall be denied, or have communications limited, with an outside support person, whether by phone, mail, video, or in person visitation, as a result of a change in the committed person's grade level or housing status or as a disciplinary sanction. Provides that committed persons may contact outside supports via phone, mail, or electronic message free of charge. Defines \"original, physical copy\"."
