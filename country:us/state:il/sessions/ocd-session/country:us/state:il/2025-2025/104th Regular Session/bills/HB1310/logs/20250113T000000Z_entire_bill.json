      "abstract": "Amends the Downstate Firefighter Article of the Illinois Pension Code. In a provision that reduces the amount of the pension for a Tier 2 firefighter who retires with at least 10 years of creditable service before attaining age 55, provides that the pension of a Tier 2 firefighter who is retiring after attaining age 50 with 20 or more years of creditable service shall not be reduced. Makes a conforming change. Provides that each annual increase for Tier 2 firefighters shall be increased on the January 1 occurring either on or after the attainment of age 55 (instead of age 60) or the first anniversary of the pension start date, whichever is later, and shall be calculated at 3% of the originally granted pension (instead of calculated at the lesser of 3% or one-half the annual unadjusted percentage increase in the consumer price index-u for a 12-month period ending in September preceding each November 1). Provides that the changes shall apply without regard to whether a Tier 2 firefighter is in active service under the Article on or after the effective date of the amendatory Act. Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement. Effective immediately."
