      "abstract": "Amends the Hospital Licensing Act. Provides that, if a physician determines that an adult patient is so disabled as to be unable to consent to discharge or placement in a facility or a physician reasonably believes an adult patient is a person with a disability in need of a guardian in accordance with the Probate Act of 1975 and there is no family, surrogate decision maker, agent under a power of attorney, trustee, or other close friend who is ready willing and able to assist that adult patient, then the hospital shall notify the Office of State Guardian and the public guardian of the county where the patient resides. Amends the Nursing Home Care Act. Requires a facility to notify the Office of State Guardian and the public guardian in the county where the patient resides before executing a contract in specified circumstances where the patient has diminished capacity.
