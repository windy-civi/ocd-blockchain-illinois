      "abstract": "Amends the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. Defines a guardian ad litem as either (i) an attorney licensed in Illinois to practice law; or (ii) a person who holds at a minimum a bachelor's degree in psychology, psychiatry, social work, education, or any other relevant child-related discipline involving determining a child's best interests. Provides that a guardian ad litem must receive training to ensure the guardian ad litem has a fundamental working knowledge of abuser tactics and its effects on children in domestic violence cases as ordered by the Supreme Court. Requires a guardian ad litem to meet with a child who has been exposed to domestic violence in an age-appropriate manner for at least an hour before the issuance of any judicial decision affecting the parental rights of the child and to meet with the child for at least an hour every 3 months and provide a written update to the court at least every 6 months. Amends the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act to make conforming changes."
