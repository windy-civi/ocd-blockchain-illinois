      "abstract": "Amends the Prior Authorization Reform Act. Provides that the Act applies to policies issued or delivered to persons who are enrolled in the State Employee Group Health Insurance Program to the extent required under a provision of the State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971 concerning required health benefits. Provides that a health insurance issuer shall not require prior authorization where a covered medication, with the exception of benzodiazepines or Schedule II narcotic drugs: (1) is prescribed for the management and treatment of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes type 1, diabetes type 2, or pre-diabetes; and (2) is for a patient currently managed with an established treatment regimen for at least 12 months. Provides that nothing in the provision prevents a health care plan from denying an enrollee coverage or imposing a prior authorization requirement if the United States Food and Drug Administration has issued a statement about the drug that calls into question the clinical safety of the drug, the drug manufacturer has notified the United States Food and Drug Administration of a manufacturing discontinuance or potential discontinuance of the drug, or the drug manufacturer has removed the drug from the market. In a provision concerning the length of prior authorization approval for treatment of chronic or long-term condition, excludes a provision of the State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971 concerning coverage for injectable medicines to improve glucose or weight loss. Effective January 1, 2027."
