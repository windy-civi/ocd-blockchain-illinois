      "abstract": "Amends the Public Utilities Act. Provides that the Illinois Commerce Commission, in a general rate case proceeding initiated by a public utility that provides water and wastewater service in Illinois, is authorized to approve rate designs requested by a public utility that provides water and wastewater service in Illinois if it finds that such rate designs will enhance the equitable provision of safe, reliable, and affordable water and wastewater services or are otherwise in the public interest. Provides that if the Commission finds that any rate design will enhance the equitable provision of safe, reliable, and affordable water and wastewater services or is in the public interest, the Commission shall enter an order approving such rate design. Requires the Commission to take certain evidence presented by the public utility into account when entering its order. Provides that the Commission may require the public utility, in addition to and as part of the required notice to its customers, to provide a description of any rate design being considered in the proceeding, a statement of the estimated bill impact as a result of rate design approved by the Commission, and any other information that the Commission deems necessary. Provides that the Commission may adopt rules to implement the provisions. Effective immediately."
