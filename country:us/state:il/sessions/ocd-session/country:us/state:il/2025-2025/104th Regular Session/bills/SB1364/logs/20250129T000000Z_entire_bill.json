Provides that violation of the provisions by either a prohibited foreign-party-controlled business entity or a prohibited foreign party owning agricultural land shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a Class 4 felony punishable by not more than 2 years imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections or a $15,000 fine, or both.
