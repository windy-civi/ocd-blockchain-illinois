      "abstract": "Creates the Database Resources for Students Act. Provides that a school district, State agency, public library, or public university or community college may offer digital or online library database resources to students in grades kindergarten through 12 only if the provider of the resources verifies that all the resources have safety policies and technology protection measures that prohibit and prevent a user of the resources from sending, receiving, viewing, or downloading and filter or block access to child pornography, obscene materials, or materials that depict child sexual exploitation. Provides that, notwithstanding any contract provision to the contrary, if a provider fails to comply with these provisions, the school district, State agency, public library, or public university or community college shall withhold further payments to the provider pending verification of compliance. Provides that if a provider fails to timely verify that the provider is in compliance, then the school district, State agency, public library, or public university or community college shall consider the provider's act of noncompliance as a breach of contract. Provides that nothing in the Act exempts from prosecution an employee of a school district, State agency, public library, or public university or community college for a willful violation of the provisions of the Criminal Code of 2012 regarding obscenity and child pornography. Sets forth reporting provisions. Amends the Charter Schools Law of the School Code to provide that the Act applies to charter schools. Effective July 1, 2026."
