Provides that each Commission shall advocate for policies, programs, and services that promote greater equity and inclusion in State government. Provides that the Governor, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives shall each appoint 3 members to each commission (with the term of a member of any of the Commissions serving on the effective date of the amendatory Act ending on the effective date of the amendatory Act), and each Commission membership shall appoint the chairperson or chairpersons. Provides that the organizational meeting of each Commission shall take place after all members are appointed but no later than 60 days after 50% or more of the members on the Commission have been appointed.

Provides that the Office shall expend funds set aside for the Commissions at the direction of the Commissions. Effective immediately."
