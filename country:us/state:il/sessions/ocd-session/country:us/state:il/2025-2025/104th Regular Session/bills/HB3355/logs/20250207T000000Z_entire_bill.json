Provides that an election authority may elect to mail a vote by mail ballot to all qualified voters instead of sending notices and applications for permanent vote by mail status. Requires the election authority to make a list of all voters to whom the vote by mail ballots will be sent, publicly post that list, and send the list to the State Board of Elections. Provides that a person who has never voted before may not be sent a vote by mail ballot under the provisions unless the person first provides the election authority with sufficient proof of identity and the election authority verifies the person's proof of identity. Provides that a person may request, in writing, to the election authority that the person not receive a ballot sent under the provisions. Provides that the election authority shall keep a record of a person who has made a request and, in all future elections following receipt of the request, shall instead send the person who made the request a notice and application for permanent vote by mail status."
