      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Vehicle Code. Establishes that a motor vehicle owner shall provide a liability policy and every such policy or bond is subject, if the motor vehicle crash has resulted in bodily injury or death, to a limit, exclusive of interest and costs, of not less than $50,000 (rather than $25,000) because of bodily injury to or death of any one person in any one motor vehicle crash and, subject to said limit for one person, to a limit of not less than $100,000 (rather $50,000) because of bodily injury to or death of 2 or more persons in any one motor vehicle crash, and, if the motor vehicle crash has resulted in injury to or destruction of property, to a limit of not less than $40,000 (rather than $20,000). Requires a motor vehicle owner or any person that maintains, uses, or operates a motor vehicle to furnish proof of financial responsibility in the amounts provided. Establishes that a judgment arising out of a motor vehicle crash is deemed satisfied once the specified policy amount is credited toward the judgment. Effective immediately."
