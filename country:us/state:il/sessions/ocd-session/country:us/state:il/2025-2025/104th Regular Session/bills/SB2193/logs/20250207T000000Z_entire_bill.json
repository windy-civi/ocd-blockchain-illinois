Provides that, subject to appropriation, the State Board of Education, in consultation with the Department of Public Health, shall develop an educational document explaining, at a minimum, the values of good indoor air quality and shall supply the document to school districts within one year after an appropriation is made for this purpose. Provides that a school district shall supply all active classroom instructors, school staff, school administrators, and district leadership with the educational document developed by the State Board. Provides that, subject to funding, a school district shall ensure that all active classrooms that are not mechanically ventilated have at least 2 properly functioning windows, or one window in situations where only one is present, that can open and can safely stay open. Provides that a school district must be in compliance within 2 years after funding is made available for this purpose. Provides that, subject to funding, a school district shall ensure that all active classrooms are equipped with an air quality monitor or sensor and an in-room air cleaner that is installed and operating. Provides that each school shall record all incidents in which the recommended parts-per-million level was breached in a classroom and maintain those records for at least 5 years. Provides that an air quality monitor or sensor and an in-room air cleaner may not be shared between active classrooms. Sets forth further provisions concerning in-room air cleaners and air quality monitors or sensors. Provides that, subject to funding, a regional office of education, an intermediate service center, or the State Board (with respect to the Chicago school district) shall undertake a ventilation verification assessment of all mechanical ventilation systems in a school district. Provides that the ventilation verification assessment shall verify whether the existing mechanical ventilation system is operating in accordance with design parameters and meets the requirements of any applicable building codes."
