      "abstract": "Amends the Suburban Bus Division of the Regional Transportation Authority Act. Requires the Suburban Bus Board to adopt responsible bidding rules applicable to bids for contracts solicited for drivers, dispatchers, customer service aides, and reservationists. Requires a bidder to submit specified information before a bidder may be considered a responsible bidder. Provides that it is the sole responsibility of the bidder to comply with all submission requirements at the time it submits its bid to the Suburban Bus Board. Provides that upon designation by the Suburban Bus Board that a contractor's or subcontractor's submission in anticipation of a bid is complete and timely, and upon any further consideration deemed necessary by the Suburban Bus Board, the contractor or subcontractor may be prequalified for future contracts with the Suburban Bus Board. Provides that a contractor's classification as qualified shall exempt the contractor or sub-contractor from the submission requirements for a period of 12 months. Provides that contractors and subcontractors who are prequalified must submit a complete application for continuation of prequalified standing on a form provided by the Suburban Bus Board by December 31st for the upcoming calendar year. Provides that failure by any prequalified contractor or subcontractor to timely submit its complete application for continuation of prequalified standing shall result in automatic removal of the designation. Allows a contractor or subcontractor removed from prequalified status to still bid on Suburban Bus Board contracts."
