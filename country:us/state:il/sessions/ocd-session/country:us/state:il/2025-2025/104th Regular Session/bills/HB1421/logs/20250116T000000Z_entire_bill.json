      "abstract": "Creates the Veterans Day Paid Leave Act. Requires each employer, subject to certain exceptions, to provide each employee who is a veteran with a paid day off on Veterans Day if the employee would otherwise be required to work on that day. Provides that the employee must provide notice to the employer that he or she intends to take time off on Veterans Day and must provide the employer with documentation verifying that he or she is a veteran. Contains provisions concerning circumstances under which an employer may deny such a time off request. Provides that, if the employer denies the time off request, the employer must make a good faith effort to provide the employee with a substitute day on which the employee may receive paid time off. Amends the Illinois Income Tax Act. Creates an income tax credit in an amount equal to 100% of the wages paid by the taxpayer to a veteran as a result of the paid day off required under the Veterans Day Paid Leave Act. Effective immediately."
