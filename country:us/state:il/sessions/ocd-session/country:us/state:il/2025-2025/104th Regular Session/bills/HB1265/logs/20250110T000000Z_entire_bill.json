In the procedures for executive clemency, provides that a victim who has supplied a statement to the Prisoner Review Board may waive notice of petitions for clemency and the waiver must be in writing. Provides that the statement supplied by the victim shall be part of all petitions for clemency filed by the petitioner. Provides that if the victim is not registered with the Board, the Board shall contact the sentencing county's State's Attorney's Office for the victim's last known address. Provides that the Board shall send notice to the last known address of the victim. Provides that at the request of the victim, the Board shall allow the victim to provide oral testimony via electronic means and not require the victim to appear in person at the executive clemency hearing. Provides that a victim who waives notice shall receive notice if the Prisoner Review Board makes a recommendation of clemency to the Governor. Provides that the notice to the victim of a recommendation of clemency shall be in writing and given not less than 30 days prior to the Board's recommendation of clemency being sent to the Governor."
