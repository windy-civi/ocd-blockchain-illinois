      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Insurance Code. Removes provisions concerning the duties of the Director of Insurance to promulgate reasonable rules requiring insurers doing business in the State of Illinois to report factual information in their possession that is pertinent to suspected fraudulent insurance claims, fraudulent insurance applications, or premium fraud after the Director has made a determination that the information is necessary to detect fraud or arson. Requires insurers to report fraudulent activity to the Director or the National Insurance Crime Bureau, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or a similar organization. Removes provisions concerning the Director's designation of data processing organizations or governmental agencies to assist in gathering and compiling fraud information. Sets forth provisions allowing any person who has a reasonable belief that an act of insurance fraud that is or may be a crime under Illinois law has been, is being, or is about to be committed or any person who collects, reviews, or analyzes information concerning insurance fraud that is or may be a crime under Illinois law to report suspected insurance fraud activity to the Director or an authorized representative of an insurer that requests the information for the purpose of directing, prosecuting, or preventing insurance fraud. Effective immediately."
