      "abstract": "Creates the Job Creation Zone Pilot Program Act. Sets forth the boundaries of the job creation zone. Provides that applicants that pledge to hire at least 5 new employees at a designated location within the job creation zone are eligible for credits against their obligation to pay over withholding taxes under the Illinois Income Tax Act. Authorizes an applicant to request a credit award under the Act by making a formal written request or application with the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. Specifies that the amount of the credit may not exceed (i) 50% of the incremental income tax attributable to each new employee during the calendar year in which the new employee is hired and for the first 2 calendar years after the new employee is hired and (ii) 25% of the incremental income tax attributable to each new employee during the third and fourth calendar years after the new employee is hired. Grants the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity rulemaking powers to implement and enforce the Act. Amends the Illinois Income Tax Act to make conforming changes. Effective immediately."
