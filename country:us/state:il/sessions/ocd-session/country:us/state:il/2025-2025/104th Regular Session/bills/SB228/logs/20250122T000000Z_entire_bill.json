      "abstract": "Amends the Department of Human Services Act. Provides that subject to appropriation, the Department of Human Services shall establish a diaper allowance program for eligible families with children 3 years of age or younger. Requires the Department to create an application process that requires applicants to submit an initial application for a diaper allowance and on an annual basis thereafter an application for a redetermination of eligibility. Requires the Department to maintain on its official website an online application system that permits an Illinois family to apply online for a diaper allowance or a redetermination of eligibility or to download a mail-in application form. Provides that paper application forms shall be made available at WIC offices and at family community resource centers throughout the State. Contains provisions concerning application requirements. Sets the monthly diaper allowance amount at $70 for eligible children whose family income is at or below 100% of the federal poverty guidelines. Provides that families may receive a diaper allowance for each eligible child and that the diaper allowance shall not be considered income for purposes of determining eligibility or the amount of assistance for any public aid benefit provided under State law. Permits the Department to distribute diaper allowance amounts electronically to an eligible family by means of an electronic benefits transfer card issued by the Department. Permits the Department to adopt rules necessary to implement the program. Contains provisions on redetermination application requirements. Provides that an advisory committee shall advise the Department on program implementation. Sets forth the composition of the advisory committee and provides that the committee shall meet monthly beginning September 1, 2025 through July 1, 2027. Effective immediately."
