Provides that, if a person is arrested in any county and the prosecutor files criminal charges based on that arrest and warrants for arrest issued by any other Illinois county exist for that person, then the court in the arresting county shall first hold, for that person, a detention hearing or other conditions of release hearing for the newly filed charges. Provides that, if a person has a warrant in another county for an offense, then, no later than 5 calendar days after the end of any detention issued on the charge in the arresting county, the county in which the warrant is outstanding may authorize the person's release from custody pursuant to a notice to appear in court in the issuing county on a date and time provided by the court in the issuing county. Makes other changes."
