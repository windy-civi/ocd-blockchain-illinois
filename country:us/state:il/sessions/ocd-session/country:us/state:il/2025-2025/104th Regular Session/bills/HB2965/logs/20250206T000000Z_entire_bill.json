      "abstract": "Amends the Criminal Code of 2012. Provides that, if a firearm that has been lost or stolen is found by a law enforcement officer, whether or not the firearm has been reported by its previous possessor as lost or stolen to the local law enforcement agency within the time period required by this provision, the law enforcement agency, upon the identification of the previous possessor of the firearm, shall issue a citation for which a penalty shall be set at $500 for a first offense and $1,000 for a second offense. Provides that, if the offender fails to pay the fine, the offender forfeits the lost or stolen firearm and the offender's Firearm Owner's Identification Card and concealed carry license, if any have been issued to the offender, are revoked. Provides that after 3 lost or stolen firearms, the court shall revoke the person's Firearm Owner's Identification Card and concealed carry license if issued to the person. Provides that any person whose Firearm Owner's Identification Card or concealed carry license is revoked as a result of this provision shall surrender all the person's firearms, the person's Firearm Owner's Identification Card, and the person's concealed carry license to the local law enforcement agency. Allows mitigating circumstances to be considered when imposing penalties."
