Makes conforming and other changes to the funding formulas. Provides that any person who earned service as a Tier 1 member or participant in any retirement system or pension fund established under this Code shall continue to earn service as a Tier 1 member and shall remain a Tier 1 member in any other retirement system or pension fund. Makes changes to the Tier 2 calculation of final average salary; the Tier 2 retirement age; and the amount of the automatic annual increases to Tier 2 annuities. Provides that, for a person who has reached the maximum percentage of salary allowed under the applicable system and who is within 5 years of the normal retirement age applicable for that member or participant, the reduction under provisions that reduce the retirement annuity due to age shall be 0%. Makes other changes. Amends the State Mandates Act to require implementation without reimbursement.
