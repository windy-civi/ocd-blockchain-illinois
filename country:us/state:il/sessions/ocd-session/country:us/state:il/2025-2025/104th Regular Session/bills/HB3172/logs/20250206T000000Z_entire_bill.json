      "abstract": "Amends the Liquor Control Act of 1934. Establishes a third-class wine-makers license. Provides that a third-class wine-makers license allows the manufacture of up to 250,000 gallons of wine per year and the storage and sale of such wine to distributors in this State and to persons without the State, as may be permitted by law. Provides that a person who has a third-class wine-maker's license and annually produces less than 250,000 gallons of wine may make application to the Illinois Liquor Control Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more than 25,000 gallons of the exemption holder's wine to retail licensees per year and to sell cider, mead, or both cider and mead to brewers, class 1 brewers, class 2 brewers, and class 3 brewers that sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries. Provides that a wine-maker's premises license shall allow a licensee who concurrently holds a third-class wine-maker's license to sell and offer for sale at retail in the premises specified in such license up to 250,000 gallons of the third-class wine-maker's wine that is made at the third-class wine-maker's licensed premises per year for use or consumption but not for resale in any form. Provides that a wine-maker's premises license shall allow the licensee to sell and offer for sale at up to 3 (instead of 2) additional locations for use and consumption and not for resale. Sets forth licensing fees for a third-class wine-maker and for a fourth location of a wine-maker's premises license."
