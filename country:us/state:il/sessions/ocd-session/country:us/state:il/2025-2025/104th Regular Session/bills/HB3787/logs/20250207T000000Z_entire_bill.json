Provides that when a vehicle is used in furtherance of a violation of the provision making it unlawful to dump, deposit, or place garbage, rubbish, trash, or refuse upon real property not owned by that person without the consent of the owner or person in possession of the real property, it is presumed that the last registered owner is responsible for such violation and shall be liable under this provision unless the presumption established is rebutted by showing that, prior to the time of the illegal dumping: (1) a report of vehicle theft was filed with respect to the vehicle; (2) the vehicle was sold or transferred, and the last registered owner provides the court and State's Attorney's office with the address of the new owner at the time of the sale or transfer; or (3) the last registered owner, still possessing the vehicle, shows proof that he or she was not driving, riding in, or otherwise in control of, the vehicle at the time the violation occurred and identifies the party who was driving the vehicle at the time of violation. Provides that if the presumption established is rebutted, the charge or charges against the last registered owner shall be promptly dismissed and the proper party shall be charged with violating this provision if possible."
