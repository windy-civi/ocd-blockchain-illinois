      "abstract": "Creates the Liability Insurance for Child Care Providers Act. Directs the Department of Children and Family Services, in consultation with stakeholders, including licensed child care providers, business owners, insurance providers, and others, to conduct a study to investigate (1) the existing regulations under the Child Care Licensing Act; (2) the availability and affordability of liability insurance for licensed child care providers; (3) the impact of regulatory actions and citations issued by licensing representatives on the ability of child care providers to obtain or maintain adequate liability insurance coverage; and (4) best practices in other states for balancing regulation and insurance requirements to promote safe and sustainable child care programs. Requires the Department to conduct a systematic review of its administrative rules and procedures as necessary to reform the child care licensing regulatory system to prioritize collaboration and educational support over punitive measures. Directs the Department to investigate specified actions that could be taken to improve the affordability of insurance for child care providers. Effective immediately."
