Provides that when a defendant previously granted pretrial release is charged with violation of any criminal offense committed while on pretrial release, the State may seek revocation of the defendant's pretrial release. Provides that when a defendant released pretrial is charged with a violation of any criminal offense committed while on pretrial release, the State may seek revocation of the defendant's pretrial release (rather than when a defendant has previously been granted pretrial release for a felony or Class A misdemeanor, that pretrial release may be revoked only if the defendant is charged with a felony or Class A misdemeanor that is alleged to have occurred during the defendant's pretrial release after a hearing on the court's own motion or upon the filing of a verified petition by the State)."
