      "abstract": "Amends the Illinois Police Training Act. Provides that the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board shall determine whether an applicant has met the requirements of the Act and is qualified to be employed as a law enforcement officer and issue a certificate to applicants qualified to be employed as a law enforcement officer. Provides that the Board may hire investigators for the purposes of complying with the Act. Provides that the Board's investigators shall be law enforcement officers. Provides that the Board shall not waive the training requirement unless the investigator has had a minimum of 5 years experience as a sworn law enforcement officer in the State. Provides that any complaint filed against the Board's investigators shall be investigated by the Illinois State Police. Provides that the Board shall create, within the Board, a Statewide Enforcement Unit. Provides that the Statewide Enforcement Unit shall be responsible for the investigation of matters concerning automatic and discretionary decertification of full-time and part-time law enforcement officers, and the prosecution of matters under those provisions. Provides that before a law enforcement agency may appoint a law enforcement officer or a person seeking a certification as a law enforcement officer in the State, the chief executive officer, sheriff, appointing authority, or designee must: (1) perform a criminal background check including reviewing criminal history and national decertification indices, and all disciplinary records by any previous law enforcement or correctional employer, including complaints or investigations of misconduct, including the outcome of any investigation regardless of the result, and the reason for separation from employment; (2) check the Officer Professional Conduct Database; (3) verify from the local prosecuting authority in any jurisdiction in which the applicant has served as to whether the applicant is on any impeachment disclosure lists; and (4) inquire into whether the applicant has any past or present affiliations with terrorist organizations.
