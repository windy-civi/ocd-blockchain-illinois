      "abstract": "Amends the Election Code. Provides that, on the date of the election, after the closing of polling locations (rather than no later than 48 hours after the closing of polling locations on election day), each election authority (rather than each election authority maintaining a website) shall post the number of ballots that remain uncounted on its website. Provides that all election authorities shall share the same information with the State Board of Elections, on the date of the election, after the closing of polling locations (rather than, no later than 48 hours after the closing of polling locations). Provides that ballots must be received by the election authority before the closing of the polls on election day (rather than returned to the election authority postmarked no later than election day). Removes a provision that allows election authorities to accept any vote by mail ballot returned, including ballots returned with insufficient or no postage. Removes a provision that authorizes election authorities to maintain one or more secure collection sites for the postage-free return of vote by mail ballots. Makes conforming changes. Effective immediately."
