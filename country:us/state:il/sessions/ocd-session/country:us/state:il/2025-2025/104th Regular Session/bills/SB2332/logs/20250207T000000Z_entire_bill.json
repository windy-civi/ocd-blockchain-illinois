      "abstract": "Amends the Livestock Management Facilities Act. Provides that, within 7 days after receiving a form giving notice of intent to construct (i) a new facility that would be a medium CAFO or a large CAFO (rather than a new facility serving 1,000 or more animal units) and that does not propose to utilize a lagoon or (ii) a new facility that does propose to utilize a lagoon, the Illinois Department of Agriculture shall send a copy of the notice form to the county board of the county in which the facility is to be located and shall publish a public notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the county. Provides that, after receiving a copy of the notice form from the Department, the county board may, at its discretion and within 60 days (rather than 30 days) after receipt of the notice, request that the Department conduct an informational meeting concerning the proposed construction. Provides that (i) a new facility that would be a medium CAFO or a large CAFO and that does not propose to utilize a lagoon or (ii) a new facility that does propose to utilize a lagoon may not begin construction if the county board recommends to the Department that the provisions of the Act have not been met for failing to satisfy specified criteria. Makes conforming and other changes."
