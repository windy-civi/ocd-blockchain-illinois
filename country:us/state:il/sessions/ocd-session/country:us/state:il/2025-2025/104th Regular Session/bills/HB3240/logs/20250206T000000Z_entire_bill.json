      "abstract": "Creates the Mobile Panic Alert System Act. Provides that the Act may be referred to as Alyssa's Law. Requires, beginning with the 2026-2027 school year, each public school to implement a mobile panic alert system capable of connecting diverse emergency services technologies to ensure real-time coordination between multiple first responder agencies. Requires, for the 2026 fiscal year, the State Board of Education to issue a competitive solicitation to contract for a mobile panic alert system that may be used by each school district. Subject to appropriation, requires the State Board of Education to establish and administer a Mobile Panic Alert System Grant Program for the purpose of issuing grants to reimburse school districts for the cost of mobile panic alert systems from moneys appropriated from the Mobile Panic Alert System Grant Fund. Amends the State Finance Act and the Charter Schools Law of the School Code to make conforming changes. Effective January 1, 2026."
